            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Shee uſually ſaid, <hi>Shee deſired that her Subject's Purſes ſhould bee her Exchequer.</hi> For, as long as they were rich, ſhee could not bee poor: Theſe Princelie and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Expreſsions took ſo with all her Subjects, (rich and poor) that ſhee never ſtirred out of the Court, but ſhee had the Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Praiers and Praiſes of Thouſands of her People, both in City and Country: And ſhee would ſhew the like tenderneſs and affection to her People. And this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God beſtowed then on this Nation, that <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> were of one Minde, one Heart, and one Faith, (except ſom few Catholicks). Her watchfull eie was ever over them; and that ſtrengthened, by God's bleſsing, her hands, that in her time ſhee did ſuch great things: in her greateſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, her Affairs were carried ſmoothly on by the prudence of her Counſel. If Grievances were by the Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament preſented unto her, it was in ſuch a decent form, (ſhee alwaies keeping the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of her State Imperial) that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Grievances appeared unto her like the
<pb facs="tcp:40135:6"/> tears of the Turtle and the mourning of Doves. Som of the Repreſentations of their Grievances in Parlament, I have ſeen and read to this effect, That if there was any thing expreſſed otherwiſe then they ſhould have repreſented, That her Majeſtie would caſt the vail of her Grace upon it, and give a favorable and benign Anſwer and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of their humble Petition. And ſurely, (next to God's gracious protection) her Safetie was built, as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Throne was, ſhee was ſupported by XII. Lyons, a grave and prudent Counſel; the number of her inward Privy Counſellors not much exceeding that number: By her proſperous Conduct and Management of her Affairs, all Chriſtendom eſteemed <hi>England</hi> to have a glorious Prince, a wiſe Counſel of State, and the People happy in general.</p>
            <p>I have read, that my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Bacon,</hi> in a Speech of his in Parlament, had this ſaying, <hi>Sure I am</hi> (ſaith that golden mouthed Orator) <hi>that the Treaſure that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Commons to her Majeſtie, is but as a vapor which ariſeth from the Earth, and gathereth into a Cloud, and ſtayeth not there long, but upon the ſame Earth falleth down again; And if ſom few drops fall upon</hi> France <hi>and the</hi> United Provinces, <hi>it is as a ſweet odor of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40135:6"/> 
               <hi>and Reputation to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation throughout the World.</hi> Elegantly expreſsing the relief that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> afforded both to <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> againſt their then common Enemy the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In her glorious Reign, the Counſells that were then in Parlament, tended ever to the individual proſperitie, and the ſafety and preſervation both of the Queen and People: And like <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coat, without ſeam, all their Counſels were of one piece, the equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of both. And after 44 years reign, this glorious Queen dyed, rich in Jewells, rich in Money and Plate, the Lands of the Crown; and, above all, rich in the Love and Eſtimation of her Loyal People, after ſhee had contended with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by invading him in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> firing and burning his Ships and Carrakes in our narrow Seas; and made her Commanders ſo terrible on the Spaniſh coaſts, that the children when they cryed, their parents would fright them with <hi>garda el Draco;</hi> which is, Bee quiet, have a care, here is <hi>Drake.</hi> I pray God, and hope to ſee the ſame fear fall on them by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Valor of Your HIGHNESS's Admiral <hi>Blake,</hi> not onely to fright their Children, but their Natives, when they are
<pb facs="tcp:40135:7"/> men, making them to cry <hi>garda el Blaco,</hi> as well as their Fathers ſaid <hi>garda el Draco.</hi> This great Quarrel at the firſt was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Queen, for the relief of the miſerable poor diſtreſſed <hi>Dutch</hi> Proteſtants, the States of the United Provinces in the Low Countries, (they had no other title in her Reign).

            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS to read but one touch more of the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and glory of this great Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> ſhee was not without her Eclipſes with troubles and fears many waies (to ſhew the uncertainty of worldly glory) even from
<pb facs="tcp:40135:8"/> her neareſt Kinſwoman <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> who, while ſhee was Queen of <hi>France,</hi> by her Husband's perſwaſion, took upon her the ſtile and title of Queen of <hi>England;</hi> from which ſprung all her troubles in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when ſhee returned a widow out of <hi>France</hi> (and this was done by Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> and her Counſel's inſtigation): Theſe troubles, by her Scotch Rebels, drove the Scotch Queen into <hi>England,</hi> whither ſhee fled for refuge; but it proved otherwiſe: for, upon that ſcore, ſhee was catch't in the net of death; and ſo much the ſooner, by reaſon of her impatience not brooking the delayes of her Deliverance; which thruſt her head-long into ſo many Treaſons, that Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> could not let her live, and bee in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty her ſelf; for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was often times heard to ſay, <hi>Either ſtrike, or bee ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:</hi> and ſo ſhee ſtruck firſt, and cut off her head; and by that means removed her Capital Enemy, (It is a certain truth, <hi>It is a dangerous thing for a ſupreme Magiſtrate to have the patience to ſtay to bee firſt ſtriken)</hi> but to put an end to thoſe plots which were daily plotting and hatching againſt her Crown and Dignity; for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had real plots for both, having found in her Study the Keys of above fifty ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:40135:8"/> Characters for ſeveral people ſhee held Intelligence with, both Forain and Engliſh Traitors. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s grave and wiſe Counſell would not let her play an after game. They had the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> tryed by a Jury of Engliſh Noblemen, many of them being Catholicks, &amp; her own friends and neereſt relations; and had they not found her guilty, many of their heads had gone off: for which very reaſon, many that the Scotch Queen took to bee her friends, were her greateſt enemies. But do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that buſineſs ſo effectually, the Queen wincked at many Noblemen; for many of her Jury that had been hatching and acting with her, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> buried their faults in oblivion. But <hi>Abington</hi> and <hi>Babington</hi> ſcaped not ſo well, being both hanged, drawn and quartered, and their Eſtates annexed to the Crown. There were others (as <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, Parry, Savage,</hi> and many more) that ſought this glorious <hi>Queen</hi>'s death, but ſhee vvas ſtill protected by the Watchman vvhich ſlumbereth not; and dyed gloriouſly, and in peace.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; vvhen King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crovvn, a <hi>Powder Plot</hi> vvas laid for him, his Vine and Olive-branches being to bee about

            <p>That many Treaſons have been plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in other Countries, and on other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as vvell as ours; to Catholicks as well as to Proteſtants, and have taken effect: They were but plotted with us, but by God's providence prevented; beyond Sea really acted, witneſs the two great Kings of <hi>France, (Henry</hi> the Third and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth) one ſtabbed before <hi>Paris,</hi> in the face of his Army; and the other King, by a raſcally Votary, a fellow conjured into the ſpirit of a <hi>Quaker</hi> (by ſuch a baſe hand died <hi>Henry</hi> the great King of <hi>France</hi> in the ſtreets of <hi>Paris)</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> murthered in <hi>Holland,</hi> being a Proteſtant Prince, by the ſame kinde of villanous hands. Theſe perils are common in all ages, to good Princes and bad Princes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Catholicks. And ſeeing theſe daily practices are and have been by God's permiſsion ſuffered to bee done, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men ought all Princes and ſupream Magiſtrates to bee, conſidering (more than

            <p>Som men (in all ages) being poſſeſſed and inſtigated by the power of the Divel, who poſſeſſeth them, and put's into their mindes, that a private man may by a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or piſtol judg and execute a Prince, if they conceiv him a Tyrant: And theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions many times prevail vvith theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Divels, whereby they act Tragedies, and ſhake vvhole Nations; and thus do ſupream Magiſtrates too frequently becom (by theſe ill-principl'd Miſcreants) upon the matter, but meer Tennants at will of their Lives and Dignities.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; there is a <hi>Peſtilent Plague</hi> that reigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, which (I humbly ſay) ought by the pruning-knife of the Law to bee lopped off from the vvholſom Tree of this flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Common-vvealth; and that is the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable <hi>Libeller,</hi> vvhich of late hath increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed openly every week, producing daily monſtrous births of Villany againſt the State. Great SIR! I humbly ſay, That theſe things ought not to bee deſpiſed, but rather lookt into; for every <hi>Libel</hi> is a knock at a carefull Magiſtrate's door; to awaken

And therefore, even as the Plague and ſundry other filthy diſeaſes are obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious and troubleſom to both the minde and body; ſo are all ſcurrilous Verſes and libellous Pamphlets, with their divelliſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in a higher degree more infectious and hurtfull to both Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth. (Now all diligence ſhould bee uſed to bring the Offenders to Juſtice, and by that means to terrifie others.) I have ſeen ſom queſtioned, but I did never ſee exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Juſtice done upon the Offenders, for theſe many years by-paſt: Som Juries in this Nation will not believ the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this fire, till (without God's great mercie) all will bee in a flame; for one Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain may bring a Plague into a City, as well as an Army; and one Conſpirator, or one Libeller, one <hi>Naples Maſſanello,</hi> againſt a Prince or State, may bee like a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt that ſtrike's upon the ſudden, and can hardly bee diſcerned, there is no defence nor preparation againſt them; one <hi>Felton</hi> in a moment extinguiſhed the Greatneſs of a Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>

            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; I had more trouble to intitle the State to this Silver in theſe ſhips, and to diſprove the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Claim to this Silver, then I ſhall have to finde out the frauds of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptants of this Nation: And if I bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to bee your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and to have an inſpection into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of this Nation, (by the aſsiſtance of God, if your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and the <hi>Parlament</hi> will ſtrictly and effectually proceed in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) it will bring your <hi>Highneſs</hi> in millions of money, for the eaſe of the good People of the Nation in general.</p>
            <p>God defend, the Commons of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould pay their Taxes and Aſſeſsments to particular perſons, who ſhall not give a juſt accompt to the Common-wealth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes and Statutes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb facs="tcp:40135:13"/> for; but not to pay their monies to private Treaſurers and Committee-men: that by theſe Imploiments, many of them have gotten vaſt poſſeſsions from the bottom of beggerie and baſeneſs, by fraud, diſsimulation and Cozenage.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; Theſe men have not moderately ſhorn the Sheep of theſe Nations, but they have rent and torn their pelts and skins from them, and they ought (I moſt humbly ſay) to pay for the mending of them; and to ſerve ſome of theſe men as <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Emſon</hi> were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, would bee a pleaſing ſight, and acceptable to the good People of the Nation.</p>

            <p>May it pleaſ Your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> In a ſhip, an ordinary Boy thereof is aſmuch bound to diſcover a Leak or a Conſpiracie in the ſaid ſhip, as the Boſon or Pilat, and hath as good intereſt to do it, becauſe his life is endangered in the concealing of it; and a poor mans life may bee as precious to himſelf as a rich mans: the ſame thing ought every man to doe, that is a faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on Land, in any Nation where hee hath protection, and much more his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for preventing all Conſpiracies to his power; and if hee make a Diſcovery of what the Supreme Magiſtrate knows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee may therein ſhew want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not want of dutie or affection to the Supreme Magiſtrate or Government where hee liveth.</p>
            <p>I humbly ſay, That man ſinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and his Conſcience, if it bee for the honor of God, the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſafetie of the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb facs="tcp:40135:14"/> if hee do not diſcover it: (and all men formerly were bound by their Oaths of Aliegiance and Supremacie to bee true to the King.)</p>
            <p>For hee that hides and conceals that which God would have revealed, puts Gods light under a Buſhel; moſt eſpecially, if it bee incumbent upon a mans ſpirits, and ſuch notions dictated unto him by the ſpirit of God, which hee never had before for the doing it; and upon reſiſting that ſpirit, may never have hereafter.</p>
            <p>This beeing my preſent condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my knees I beſeech your <hi>Highneſs</hi> to be graciouſly pleaſed to grant your favorable peruſal of this Epiſtle and Book, beeing far larger then at firſt I intended, proceeding from a moſt humble, dutifull and loial heart, for your <hi>Highneſs</hi> Securitie, Peace, Honor and Safety.</p>

            <p>In purſuance thereof, You are (aſmuch as in you lieth) to keep from power or publick Imploiment all ſuch as You and your Counſel ſhall know to bee publick or ſecret undermining Enemies of the peace &amp; welfare of this Common-wealth, by what pretences, titles or callings ſoever, whether Civil, Militarie or Eccleſiaſtical. You and your great Counſell (upon my bended knees I ſay) are to have a ſpecial care of ſome men, who, under the pretence of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Rights of the people in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, would (upon that popular ſcore) vent their own diſcontents, and put all again into a confuſion: with what ſpirits ſome old Members came to ſerve the Nation in this
<pb facs="tcp:40135:15"/> Parlament, was viſibly ſeen to all men that wiſhed the peace of this Nation, in ſome Counties upon their election, and in their ordinary converſation and deportment: The ſcope and drift of ſome mens deſignes was to make diviſion and faction between the <hi>Parlament</hi> and your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> between the <hi>City</hi> and your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and put all things into a confuſion this preſent day, to make way for the publick Enemies of your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and this Nation. This was by ſome particular perſons (no doubt) intended (and all men that ſtudie and love the peace of their Countrey might ſee it) under ſuch cunning undermining queſtions, as was by ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſpirits ſet on foot the laſt Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, craftily to undermine the very Body and Beeing of the Government, and ſliely to ſtrike at both your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and your Poſterities Life, Fame and Fortunes, and to pluck up by the roots your <hi>Highneſs</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and the eſtabliſhed Government, which your <hi>Highneſs</hi> (by the Advice of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel had ſetled); witneſs, the many Libells of all ſorts and tempers, to ſtir up commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſeveral Parts and Parties, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients beeing prepared for all Intereſts to incenſe and infuſe a hatred and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent Government; and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <hi>That ſome factious Cocks, which crew ſo loud in the Countrey, now they are kept out of the Pit, may return home to their Houſes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Capons, and ſleep quietly in their rooſts; it will bee a happineſs both to themſelvs, their Countrey, their Wives and Children, their Friends, Tennants, Servants and Neighbors (if they do ſo); and their not doing of it, may bring diſturbance on the Nation, and a certain ruine upon themſelvs, their Wives and Children. It is an old trick, Divide and Rule: and many that have had the power, will leave no stone unturned to get again into play; ſo they laugh, they care not if the whole Nation cries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many good People who have been miſled, upon the notion of Libertie and Freedom; And if your HIGHNESS and your Supreme Counſel (the Parlament) do not give a ſtop by your power and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, even at this juncture of time (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods mercie) things may run into great Diſorders.</p>
            <p>Therefore your HIGHNESS and the
<pb facs="tcp:40135:16"/> Parlament (I moſt humbly upon my knees ſay) muſt build the walls of our <hi>Jeruſalem (England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions thereunto belonging) as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did that of the Jews. Your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and the Parlament have many <hi>Samballats</hi> that envies your Building and ſcorns your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; there are many of the Children of Separation and Diviſion in theſe Lands.</p>
            <p>When a wiſe man would keep his Houſe from falling, (that is rent &amp; ſhaken with great tempeſts,) he props it up with timber, cramps it with Iron bolts and barrs; and, it may be, upon the propping of it to ſet it upright, cracks the ſeiling and fret-work of the beſt and ſtatelieſt room in his Houſe; ſurely if either the Wife or the Children or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould come and complain to the Owner what dammage this beautifull room hath received, the Maſter of the Houſe and his Workmen have at hand a readie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which is, Should hee not have prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and crampt the Houſe with Iron bolts and barrs, the whole fabrick would have fallen, and the Houſe have been made a heap of rubbiſh, both hee and they would have had no place to keep them from the weather.</p>
            <p>By this my propping and cramping up
<pb facs="tcp:40135:17"/> my Houſe (ſaith the wiſe Maſter and his VVorkmen) I have ſecured and got my <hi>Eſſe,</hi> I have kept my beeing; when my Houſe is new tiled and tyte, to keep out the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you ſhall have your deſire, I will give you all content, I will cauſe Plaiſterers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and garniſh that ſeiling which you are ſo much offended with the cracking of; I will new gild it, and make it more beautifull then ever it was, provided you will put to your hands to ſweep down the Cob-webbs, and carrie away the rubbiſh, and ſo cleanſe and clear my Houſe; do this, I promiſe you I will do the other.</p>
            <p>No doubt, but a wiſe and dutifull familie will do it chearfully with thanks, for their <hi>Eſſe</hi> and beeing hath been preſerved through the Maſter of the families Providence.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; I humbly ſay, The good people of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under your protection, ought (at this juncture of time) earneſtly to pray to God, that the foundations of their Happineſs may bee ſo laid, this Parlament (as to ſecure firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their beeing) that they may have an <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and then comes the <hi>Bene,</hi> that it may bee as firmly ſetled upon as ſure a foundation as a Rock, againſt whom no diviſions or force can or ſhall prevail.</p>

               <hi>For the effectual Security of theſe Nations, that this Parlament would bee pleaſed to erect a high Court of Justice, to ſweep down the cob-webbs, remove the rubbiſh, clear the houſe, and by Juſtice restrain and (if incorrigible) cut off un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and violent ſpirits. Wiſe men cut their coats according to their cloth, and will bee ſure to keep themſelvs warm, before they buy Lace to trimm them. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my knees I humbly deſire your</hi> Highneſs, <hi>to put the Nation in a poſture of defence, againſt home-bred Traytors and forain Force, and then bee pleaſed to garniſh the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with rich and ſtately Priviledges.</hi>

               <hi>The Diviſions at home are farr more deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and dangerous, than any forain Force or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion can bee to this Nation.

            <p>God divided the red Sea, and made a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the Children of <hi>Iſraël</hi> to bring them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> this I finde and reade; but I never found nor read, that God would have divided the red ſea, and given them a ſafe Paſſage, if they would have left <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and returned into the red Sea again for <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVee have a Proverb, <hi>The pot goes often to the water, but at laſt it comes broken home.</hi> Gods providence hath gone along with us, while hee bids us go and fight his battell, wee have ſeen the ſucceſs. No man can promiſe a Bleſsing, when wee fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelvs for ſhadows, and neglect our common Safeties. Many men have laid their deſignes to bring a miſchief about, ſo deep, that when they ſpring their mines, the powder that makes the train ſhall bee free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and priviledge of Parlament, Gods Cauſe, and what not, to make a diſturbance. The truth is, if ſome men would ſpeak their mindes truly, there are a ſort of people do but <hi>cajole</hi> the common people, and blow them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcontents to get into places of power, as
<pb facs="tcp:40135:18"/> 
               <hi>Abſalom</hi> did, with <hi>I would I were a Judg in Iſraël, what Juſtice would I do?</hi> ſo ſaies ſome male-contented Members that were of the long Parlament, If wee can but revive <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> get the long Parlaments power to ſit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly; VVell, what then? wee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the People to their Libertie; Even as much as you did it when you had the power; for they had ſo entangled themſelvs and the Nation, that rich and poor, young and old, were glad they were diſſolved; and many of them are aſhamed of their own doings, yet ſome of the old Members would fain bee at the old VVork.</p>
            <p>They vvould (had they your <hi>Highneſs</hi> povver) deſtroy and pluck up by the roots You, that had vvrung the povver out of their hands, alſo your Poſteritie, your Counſel, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and all your relations. I humbly ſay, I beleeve theſe vvould bee the Actions of ſome of the Members of the long Parlament, had they the povver again; and this is the ſtudy of ſome diſcontented Members.</p>
            <p>To ſtir up and foment the ſeveral hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and tempers of ſome factious people, to gather together and involve us in blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, vvhat meaneth the daily ſeditious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Libells elſe? if your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, and Army look not vigilantly about
<pb facs="tcp:40135:19"/> to ſuppreſs theſe male-contents, (before they get a head) by exemplarie Juſtice. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſay, the miſchief is not ſo inconſiderable, that it ſhould bee diſpiſed.</p>
            <p>And if it ſhould ſo fall out, that this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ſhould burſt out, (as God of his infinite mercie defend) by the neglect either of your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> the Parlament or Armie; no doubt but God, having put us of theſe Nations into your hands for juſt protection, for ſuch as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to you for conſcience ſake; the ſame God vvill require a juſt accompt of your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> Parlament and Armie, hovv you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged this great truſt; and vvhereſoëver the failing of the Truſt is, God vvill expect a ſtrict accompt, and puniſh it: for mens lives ought not to bee ſpilt as water on the ground, nor their goods plundered, to ſatisfie factious and private ſpirits: The ſupreme Magiſtrate is to ſee the peace of the Nation not to bee diſturbed upon particular factions, though they bee multitudes. The Magiſtrate ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us is not to bear the ſword in vain: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is ſomtimes more ſeaſonable for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (upon incorrigible Offenders) then Mercie, that others may take example.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; A maſter of Ship in a ſtorm at ſea, may fling goods over-board, for ſaving the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
<pb facs="tcp:40135:19"/> Ship, and Loading; and the Owners muſt bear the loſs, with thanks for his care; which if hee ſhould do in a calm, (fling the goods over-board) hee vvould deſerve blame and to pay for the merchandize: That may lawfully bee done in dangerous times, which cannot bee juſtified in quiet times.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Priviledges in a quiet time, vvhich may and ought to bee ſtood u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, which at this time are deſtructive to the very beeing and ſafetie of the Nation; For if every man ſhould bee admitted to give Phyſick that the Neighbors preſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend out of love to a ſick man, the patient may quickly bee purged out of the vvorld: Dangerous times muſt have skilfull, valiant, and vigilant managers of their Affairs, and not diſcontented perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee ſee in Fevers, Calentures, and Lunacies, wiſe Phyſitians ſometimes bindes the hands, and give their Patients thin and ſpare diet; which, by the care and attendance of the Phyſitian and Friends, the Sick are again recovered: Surely when they are in health, theſe mad men ought to thank their Phyſitian and Friends, as beeing (under God) the Inſtruments that gave them Life and Beeing: When theſe mad men are well recovered, they need not to bee reſtrained within doors, they need not to bee debarred of a free</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40135:20"/> 
               <hi>and plentifull diet, but to enjoy all they have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to diſpoſe of it as they pleaſe themſelvs.</hi> If theſe Rules vvere not obſerved, when men are in a Lunacie or Sick, it would deſtroy Societie, and bee deſtructive to mankinde. A mad man with a knife may cut his own throat; vvith a ſword, kill and wound all hee meets. A Sick man may eat or drink ſo much as may kill him, fling off the cloaths, or otherwiſe diſorder himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now, may it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> If theſe bee ordinary bonds and relations of Chriſtianity, Neighbor-hood and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between partie and partie, and is uſed amongſt the moſt barbarous Nations, as the means to preſerve a beeing; hovv much more is it your <hi>Highneſs</hi> Dutie and Place, and God expects it from your hands (beeing aſsiſted vvith the ſupreme Court of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to bee a good and mercifull Phyſitian to the diſtempered and ſick men of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ſome old Members of the long Parlament? A diſeaſe of the minde, and an inveterate heart are not curable, but by Gods bleſsing: ſuch evil ſpirits are not caſt out but by Praier and Faſting. How mercifully have you dealt with ſome of them that were choſen to ſit in Parlament, in not ſuffering them to runn upon that (which certainly had ſome of them been admitted to ſit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40135:20"/> 
               <hi>they would have runn themſelves upon a Rock to their own Confuſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May it pleaſ Your HIGHNESS; I do not ſay, all thoſe Gentlemen that were not at firſt admitted, God defend; for many, no doubt, are honorable and worthie Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and will give your HIGHNESS, the Parlament and Counſel juſt ſatisfaction. The like (I moſt humbly ſay) for thoſe honorable and worthie Gentlemen, that are gone down into their Countries; no doubt, many upon their private occaſions to ſettle their Buſineſs, and return to do the Parlament and Nation Service.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your HIGHNESS; there is a ſaying, Hee is more mercifull that prevents a man from falling, then hee that takes him up after hee is fallen, and could have ſtaid his falling; it ſhews an aboundance of bowels of mercie, that your <hi>Highneſs</hi> would not let ſome men run their deſperate courſe, that they, when they were entangled in the net of their own inventions, might have enriched your Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers by their Confiſcations, and ruined their families.</p>
            <p>God hath put it into your heart, to ſave them as a brand out of the fire; for had they been let alone, they had ſome of them burnt their wings. If they reade the Hiſtorie of
<pb facs="tcp:40135:21"/> former Kings Craft (as King <hi>James</hi> uſed to call it); they conſtantly made Riſings and Tumults an advantage unto them by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations and Forfeitures, to augment the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Crown. And, no doubt, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man for the very covetouſneſs to get his Eſtate) ſome Kings have hatched and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived old Treaſons themſelvs, to get and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare ſometimes Innocents, and ſometimes heedleſs Traitors. Hiſtories, both divine and profane have ſuch examples.</p>
            <p>God ſend ſome men never to forget your <hi>Highneſs</hi> goodneſs; for when they had runn their courſe (as ſome Gentlemen in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> have done) ſome would have com to untimely deaths, others to baniſhment, and all to ruine and infamie (to the break-heart of their Wives, Children, and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons); and ſome others, with ſorrow, teares, and unfeigned repentance, to have begged for their lives, and (peradventure) not obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, being cut off in their prime &amp; ſtrength, before half their daies are runn out.</p>
            <p>Their Wives, Children, and Relations of ſome Families in this Nation, are bound to bleſs God for ever, that put it into your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> heart to prevent ſome men in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould not forfeit their lives nor eſtates: a great mercie (with reverence
<pb facs="tcp:40135:21"/> bee it ſpoken) <hi>in imitation of the great God of Heaven, that hath ſaid,</hi> I will not the death of a ſinner; <hi>and with long ſuffering and patience beareth with ſinfull man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and lighter then the duſt in the balance. What are the private male-contents of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your</hi> Highneſs <hi>hands, ſo long as you make God your Shield and Buckler? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Gods ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and tuition, mighty Kings and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths have not been able to reſiſt the force of your Armies and Navies; (witneſs,</hi> Holland, Denmark, Portugal, <hi>&amp;c.) that God that hath delivered you from the Bear and the Lyon, will deliver you from theſe uncircumciſed Philiſtins, if you put your truſt in him.</hi>

            <p>Let this bee the end of your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s malicious and implacable Enemies; others that erre through mis-information or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Judgment, I pray God to ſhew them a ſight of their ſins, and give your <hi>Highneſs</hi> a mercifull heart, ſo freely to pardon them, as your Self would expect Gods pardon; that ſo, through the great mercie and protection of our God, theſe three Nations (after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Earth-quakes, Overturnings, and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and memorable Revolutions) may bee firmly grounded and ſetled on the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Libertie and Freedom, Truth, Mercy, and Peace; to the aſtoniſhment and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, horror and confuſion of home-bred Traitors and forain Nations, your <hi>Highneſſes</hi> and our Nations Enemies.</p>

            <p>Theſe mens Eggs were buried (no doubt) in <hi>India</hi> Gold; but, by the good guidance of God, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Eggs will prove addle; He is ſo ſubtle (by the Counſel of his Jeſuites, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting themſelvs into all ſhapes) for hee doth moſt of his work by the Jeſuites, who ſow and foment new Doctrines amongſt us, that have bewitched and cracked the heads of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men in theſe Nations, which do the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and Papiſts work, and know it not.</p>
            <p>VVhen your <hi>Highneſs</hi> Navies ſailed to the <hi>VVeſt-Indies,</hi> You cauſed them to bee ſheathed with Planks, Pitch and Hair, that the worms which breed in thoſe Seas might do no hurt or prejudice to the hull or bulk of their Ships.</p>
            <p>Great SIR! <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may well bee compared to three Roial Ships, and the Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> to a moſt Princely Frigot, Your <hi>Highneſs</hi> by the grace

            <p>Your <hi>Highneſs</hi> hath now a Warr with Him that ſtiles himſelf <hi>the Emperor of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> This Prince is Maſter of a Metall that is as dangerous to all Princes in Chriſtendom, their Perſons, Countries, Lands and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as the Worms in the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas are to the Merchants ſhips.

            <p>Upon my knees I moſt humbly ſay, As you ſheathe your Ships you ſend to <hi>India</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:40135:24"/> fear of the VVorm; ſo your <hi>Highneſs</hi> muſt ſheathe the Cinque-ports and Creeks of your HIGHNEſs Dominions, you muſt fortifie and garriſon the Sea-ports of this Nation, and the People bee alwaies readie (both in hand and heart, all as one man) to fight for our Religion, Countrey, our Lives, Wives and Children, Lands and Eſtates; and without this bee done, wee ſhall not have a Beeing, Eſtates or Proprietie: this is the one thing neceſſary and chiefly to bee lookt after, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and ſecure the Nation againſt home-bred Traitors and forain Forces.</p>
            <p>And, if any ſhould preſume to aſſault us, wee may bee afore-hand, and by our Navies deſtroy their Ships &amp; Veſſels in their own Seas, let their Land be died with their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> blood, let their barren Countrey bee fatned with their own Carkaſſes; and as they give in their Monies the Sheaf of Arrows, as a remembrance of the great Victories they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by the Valor of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo now, for their Ingratitude, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> may cry as they did in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Counſel, SIR, <hi>Let us have Peace with</hi> England, <hi>and Warr with all the World.</hi> And if they did ſo when this Nation had but one <hi>Drake,</hi> and a ſmall Fleet (in compariſon of what your
<pb facs="tcp:40135:25"/> Highneſs hath, wee having now many ſcore of <hi>Drakes,</hi> which if they bee impowered with your HIGHNESS Commiſsion, and Gods Bleſsing thereupon) they ſhall never bee able to bring home their Treaſures from the <hi>VVeſt-Indies;</hi> and though our Fleet wait long, no doubt the Vigilancie of your Admirals will make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pay for their attendance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About ſixteen years ago, God (out of his ſecret Judgment) struck the Crown of</hi> Spain <hi>with a dead Palſie on one ſide, by the revolting of the</hi> Portugals, <hi>their right heir and true King aſſumed the Crown,</hi> viz. <hi>the Duke of</hi> Bragantza; <hi>ſo that now your</hi> Highneſs <hi>fights but with one half of the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>as hee was formerly; the other half the</hi> Portugal <hi>will aſsiſt You in all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (both in Christendom,</hi> Africa, <hi>Eaſt and West</hi> Indies) <hi>to destroie the</hi> Spaniards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that as God hath raiſed your</hi> Highneſs <hi>to this Greatneſs admirably, to have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity and Dominion of theſe Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo by this rent and diviſion of</hi> Portugal <hi>from</hi> Spain, <hi>God hath facilitated and made the way eaſie for your</hi> Highneſs <hi>to cut down and pluck up by the roots this barren Tree the</hi> Spaniards. <hi>And thoſe Nations in the</hi> West-Indies, <hi>which at this day live under the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Tyranny, and are now fed with the chaff and bran of</hi> Popiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <hi>may bee (by the bleſsing of God) fed with the pure manchet of the</hi> Goſpel, <hi>and at once bee delivered from bodily and ſpiritual ſlavery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My daily praier to God is, to keep us u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous in this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> as wee and our Predeceſſors were in famous Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies; that it may bee the ſtudy of every good Proteſtant in this Nation with heart, hand and purſe, to deſtroy the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greatneſs.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spains</hi> Power is now not half ſo much as it was before <hi>Portugal</hi> revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, and his Power is now farr more in ſhew then ſubſtance; his Territories and Dominions are at ſuch a diſtance one from another, they ſtand like the haires of King <hi>James's</hi> beard, ſcatteringly, as if one was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of another: the charges of Garriſons, and to keep his Dominions under his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doth coſt him (in ſome Countries) farr more to keep the bare Title, then the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Countries amount unto, witneſſe our next Neighbour <hi>Flanders;</hi> and the like is for many other of his Dominions, that year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coſt him many hundred thouſand pound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee holds a VVolf by the ears; and if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could bee well rid of them, both Hee, and his Counſel (no doubt) wiſhes both <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> drowned in the

Theſe are the very words of that Statute.</p>
            <p>Upon the delivery of this Writing, Your moſt humble Subject received Your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s gracious pleaſure by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And many of them (upon examination) will bee found to have at this time vaſt ſumms of money in their hands and poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them all, to the value of many hundred thouſand pounds, Likewiſe your loial Subject hath moſt humbly preſented your <hi>Highneſs</hi> how ſtrict Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> was to have all her Receivers called to a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, never ſparing her great Officers and Favorites, by which means ſhee lived and died rich, never finding want in her Exchequer, nor her Cheſts without Treaſure.</p>

            <p>The Lawes now in force (to bee duely and truely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for to have an exact accompt) will bring your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and the Common-wealth in milions of money: there is not any one of the aforeſaid perſons can ſhew any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Ordinance, Act of the Council of State or Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, (that when they were made Committee-men or Treaſurers) to give them, or any one of them, a privilege or indempnity to cozen and defraud the State, or to licence any one of them to pocket up the Wealth and publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Nation, which they have fraudulently conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their own uſe. And when they can ſhew no ſuch privilege, (nor ſo much as a pardon) they need not make it ſtrange, as many of them do at this day, That they ſhould bee forced to give the Common-wealth a juſt, ſtrict, and true Accompt, or elſ their Bodies and Eſtates, as alſo their Heirs, Executors, Adminiſtrators and Aſsigns to bee lyable, till they ſhall have juſtly and truly accompted.</p>

            <p>Whereas your Supplicant, after he was out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> petitioned for ſix years conſtantly at the Parlament doors the members, and at the Counſel of State, to have a legal Trial by the Parlament, or elſ by the common Law; And to that end delivered ſeveral Petitions to ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parlament, yet your Supplicant could never have Juſtice. Som of the members of the then Parlament, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his many years conſtant attendance, and great expence, to com to a trial, told him, <hi>Had hee been guilty, hee ſhould never needed to have petitioned the Parlament for a Trial; the Parlament would have granted him a Trial without petitioning for it.</hi>

            <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> This is your moſt humble Subjects ſad condition, groaning under, and having ſo heavy a ſentence as the loſs of almoſt all his eſtate, to his dammage above eleven thouſand pounds, almoſt four years Impriſonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> when there was no law made at his acting this Buſineſs, nor at the time of his Commitment, for either puniſhing of him, or any other, for acting the ſame thing (which was, bringing up the late Kings letter to the City in <hi>December</hi> 1643) but Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

            <p>Hee hath printed this Buſineſs, with the ſeveral Houſes, Offices, Bonds and Mony taken from him; To which hee doth moſt humbly refer himſelf, And Your Supli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant was daily faithfully promiſed by ſom worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Long Parlament and Counſel of State, (who pittied Your Supplicant's ſad Condition, ſeeing his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſerve the Commonwealth) to have Juſtice and Reparation: and that held up his Spirits, and kept him alwaies to bee willing, to the uttermoſt of his power and ſtrength-beyond the abilities of his Eſtate, to engage both his time and eſtate, for many years, to do the then Parlament many and great ſervices, as appears by Your Loyal Subject sprinted <hi>Narrative,</hi> 1653.

               <hi>After, within two dayes time Your Supplicant waited on the Lord</hi> Bradſhaw, <hi>and</hi> Committee for Forrain Affairs, <hi>and told them, hee would undertake to diſprove the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's Claim to all this Silver, by Legal and undeniable Proof: And would prove, by clear Teſtimony, That there was ſeveral great quantities of Silver in theſe Ships that did not appertain to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>or his Subjects; but to the</hi> Dutch <hi>of the</hi> United Provinces. <hi>Thereupon the</hi> Counſel of State <hi>by their Order of</hi> December <hi>the</hi> 13, 1652, <hi>Ordered Your Subject to aſsiſt, and bee in the nature of a Remembrancer, and to repair to Doctor</hi> Walker <hi>from time to time, who is the</hi> Commonwealth<hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the proſecuting of theſe Ships</hi> (Sampſon, Salvador, <hi>and</hi> George,) <hi>which accordingly hee did.</hi>

            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40135:33"/>
            <p> Thereupon, the day the ſhips were to be diſcharged the Court of Admiralty, your humble and faithfull Subject made his proteſt in the Court of Admiraltie againſt the Judges and their Proceedings, as appears by the Certificate of the Officers of the Mint herewith preſented: And your Supplicant likewiſe declared in the Court of Admiraltie, that the Judges (but at their perils) ſhould not proceed to clear or diſcharge all or any of the afore-named ſhips, (as the <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> or <hi>George)</hi> till your Supplicant's wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were examined in the behalf of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. This was <hi>Decem.</hi> 17. 1643.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Court of Admiraltie required your Supplicant to appear before the Counſel of State, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at three of the clock, to anſwer before the Counſel of State to their Charge for your Supplicants Action and Proteſt in the Court of Admiralty; your Supplicants Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt being made againſt and contrary to an Order of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Judg <hi>Exton</hi> affirmed in the Court of Admiralty.</p>
            <p>There was many hundred of Merchants in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors Secretary, Duke <hi>Leopoldus</hi> his Agents, and ſeveral Spaniards, when your Supplicant made his Proteſt againſt the diſcharge of theſe ſilver ſhips, ſilver and merchandiſe: And that very day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at the Counſel of State, before the Judges of the Admiralty, upon reading of ſom papers, your Supplicant humbly preſented againſt the diſcharge of the ſhips (the <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George)</hi> and all their ſilver and lading. Upon a full debate before the Counſel of State, theſe three ſhips and ſilver were all (by Order of the Counſel) ſtayed; and your <hi>Supplicant</hi> had thanks given him by the Counſel for his faithfull ſervice; and preſently commanded with all diligence to make his proof, whereby to diſprove the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Claims.</p>
            <p>In the further proſecution of this Buſineſs, your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant received ſeveral Orders of the Counſel of State and of your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Counſel, which ordered him from time
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40135:34"/> to time to make his Addreſſes, and adviſe with Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> (your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Advocate) in this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> knows, that for 16 months together, your Supplicant employed many people in this Buſineſs, againſt the ſhips <hi>(Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George)</hi> their ſilver and lading. Your Subject employed ſeveral perſons in the tranſlation of Spaniſh and Dutch Papers, which are in the Regiſtrie of the Admiraltie; other perſons your Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant daily employed amongſt the Paſſengers and Seamen that belonged to theſe ſhips, to finde out and know what ſilver appertained and belonged to <hi>Holland,</hi> and all other matters that might tend to the diſcovery of this Buſineſs, conſtantly (as I ſaid) employing about ten men in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as appears by their ſeveral <hi>Affidavits,</hi> for neer ſixteen months together. All theſe mens expences at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Boat-hire, and payment of them for their time, your moſt humble Supplicant out of his own purſ hath diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And this hee did, to enable himſelf to do this ſervice, and to finde out the bottom of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors fraud, in claiming this ſilver. Your Supplicant (at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt entreaty of Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> as appears by his Warrants to the Examiner and Regiſter of the Admiralty) did cauſe to be breviated and read, and took notes of many thouſand ſheets of paper: ſom papers hee cauſed to bee tranſlated out of Dutch and Spaniſh into Engliſh, concerning the ſilver ſhips. For almoſt three months together, this was your Supplicants and ſeveral mens works; <hi>viz.</hi> one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Glover,</hi> that had lived a long time in <hi>Holland,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40135:34"/>
            <p> And had your Supplicant failed to make good his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and not to have proved what hee undertook to do, hee had been totally a ſecond time undone. Your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant muſt confeſs, that the old Counſel of State in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1652. many of them told him, If hee ſhould fail of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooving the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Claim, and could not prove what hee had alleged to the Counſel of State, that in theſe ſhips there was ſilver appertained to the Dutch of the United Provinces, That then his proteſting againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this ſilver, would totally undo your Supplicant, and bee his utter ruine.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and your moſt honorable Counſel, will ſee it cleerly proved, the great expence, pains and hazzard which your humble Subject hath been at till this very day, your Petitioner paying intereſt for above five hundred pounds; which money, every penny, hee expended in this ſervice (as appears by the Oaths of ſeveral perſons which your Supplicant employed, and they were privy to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſaid ſumms of money onely in this ſervice. (Theſe original Papers remain in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And your humble Supplicant truſts in God and your Highneſs, that hee ſhall have his Eſtate reſtored, or the full value, for doing this great ſervice, according to the then promiſe of the then Counſel of State, whereof your <hi>Highneſs</hi> was then a Member.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> Had the long Parlament and Counſel of State coined the money which your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant ſtayed, or altered the property thereof, hee is really aſſured by many honorable Gentlemen of the long Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the then Counſel of State, that hee ſhould have had full ſatisfaction with thanks for this great ſervice: But they could not pay the Reward, before they received the Benefit. I humbly ſay, <hi>The old Counſel of State ſet mee (your loyal Subject) to beat the buſh for them, but your Highneſs caught the Bird; and ſince your Supplicant hath acted by ſeveral Orders of your Highneſs's Counſel, beeing promiſed by them a juſt</hi>

               <hi>and good Reward, I do moſt humbly implore your Highneſs for the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Petitioner hath printed theſe Examinations, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Tranſactions and Paſſages, and humbly tenders them at your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s and the Parlaments feet; that ſo your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and the Parlament may ſee the ſervice your Supplicant hath done. Had hee not taken this courſ, it had been impoſſible for him to have cleerly ſtated it to your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and the Parlament, and alſo to the whole Nation and world in general, what charges and pains hee hath been at to do this ſervice. This will cleerly ſhew to the world the juſt cauſ the then Parlament and Counſel of State had in 1652 for the ſtaying theſe ſhips <hi>(Sampſon, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador,</hi> and <hi>George)</hi> and their ſilver, from undeniable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Upon the ſight whereof, the mouths of many clamoring merchants will be ſtopped, when they ſee upon what grounds this ſilver was ſtayed, and the clear witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and proofs for to juſtifie the truth, to diſproov the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ambaſſadors and Spaniards Claims to all this ſilver in theſe ſhips.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> it is out of the mouths of many of the Paſſengers in theſe ſhips that (this Voiage) came from <hi>Spain</hi> aboard theſe very ſhips, all able and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible witneſſes; they have confeſſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That great quantities of this ſilver and merchandiſe was delivered a ſhip board in <hi>Spain</hi> for the accompt of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and other parts of the United Provinces.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ſeveral Adviſes from beyond Seas from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> (by the Parlaments Agent at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lucars in <hi>Spain</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40135:35"/> three ſilver ſhips, being taken by the Parlaments men of Warr at ſea, were diſcharged from them, pretending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to bee bound for <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and ſo got diſcharged; and immediately, when they had got from our Fleet, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly into <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> The ſhips that ſo fraudulently cleared themſelvs and got into <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> after they were in the poſſeſsion of the Parlaments ſhips, were worth neer upon a million of money: had thoſe ſhips been brought to <hi>London,</hi> that Buſineſs had broak the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is proved, that when theſe ſhips ſet ſail to go their voyage, they all ſet ſail from <hi>Holland</hi> Ports.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is proved by ſeveral merchants of <hi>London</hi> (that have put in their claims to ſeveral parcels of ſilver in theſe three ſhips) That ſeveral parcels of ſilver then aboard theſe ſhips, was loaden and put aboard theſe ſhips for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per accompt of merchants of <hi>London. Which clearly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors Claims to all this ſilver (as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſilver, and onely for his Catholick Majeſtie, and his Subjects accompt) to bee a notortous State trick, and forged to get the Treaſure out of the States hands, that was in theſe ſhips.</hi> And if the Spaniſh Ambaſſador could have done it, hee was to have had many thouſand pounds of the owners for doing of this State Buſineſs; but (by Gods aſſiſtance) your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Supplicant prevented him, to his great expence and danger of his life for doing this ſervice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is confeſſed and proved, That ſeveral parcels of ſilver aboard theſe ſhips, were entred in Bills of Lading by feigned names, and colorably to avoid the taking of the ſilver and monies, likewiſe to avoid the adjudication and condemnation of the ſame, if theſe ſilver ſhips and their lading were ſeized on; <hi>and that the Bills of Lading now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Court of Admiralty, were forged at ſea, when they heard wee had warrs with Holland, and all the Dutch names of the Bills altered.</hi> This is proved.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is in the Admiralty the States Generals Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to <hi>De Wit</hi> and <hi>De Rutter</hi> (their Vice-Admirals)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40135:36"/> to guard theſe ſhips from the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And this was done upon the petition of the merchants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to the States General. Theſe Letters and original Commiſsions under the great Seal of <hi>Holland</hi> I have printed; and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals can bee produced when there is occaſion. Without doubt the merchants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> would not have petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the States Generals for a Convey for theſe ſhips, had not the Lading and ſilver belonged to them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Your <hi>Highneſs</hi> will ſee (upon the whole matter and proſecution of this Buſineſs) your moſt humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant hath left no ſtone unturned, nor ſpared any coſt haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard or pains to do the Parlament (and ſince your <hi>Highneſs)</hi> this ſervice.) And your humble Supplicant is fully aſſured, That it is a far eaſier work for him to diſcover the frauds of the Accomptants and Committee men of this Nation, if hee had a Commiſsion to bee your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer, to ſee this Buſineſs effectually proſecuted, than to have made this Diſcovery of theſe ſilver ſhips.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Hee hath clearly proved ſeveral unfree goods and parcels of ſilver aboard theſe ſhips, appertaining to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> (then our Enemies) which hath made all the ſilver and merchandiſe lyable to a ſeizure and confiſcation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs; In</hi> France, <hi>one parcel of goods found a ſhip-board, and conſigned to an enemy, confiſcates all the ſhip and goods. In</hi> Spain <hi>and in</hi> Holland, <hi>one barrel of But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or a caſe of Piſtolls conſigned but as a preſent to a friend, ſhall confiſcate both ſhip and goods. And your humble Subject hopes, the ſame Law that is civil for them beyond the Seas to judg and put upon our Merchants and their Ships and Merchandize there, ſhall not bee held in</hi> England <hi>to be an uncivil Law, and a breach of</hi> Jus Gentium, <hi>when it is but the ſame meaſure of Juſtice which hath been in this Buſineſs adminiſtred to Forrainers here, which Forrainers adminiſter to our Merchants beyond the Seas? And this is a known truth in many Merchants caſes, that had not ſo much Juſtice in</hi> Spain, <hi>as wee have given to Forrainers here, even in theſe their ſilver Ships.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat as they were at <hi>Cales,</hi> they took in all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Silver, the moſt of which was brought in by night; amongſt the reſt, 40 barrs of Silver loaden by the order of a <hi>Portugees</hi> at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Lucars,</hi> and conſigned to his Brother (a Jew dwelling in <hi>Amſterdam).</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When they had been ten daies at ſea, the Purſer was ordered by the Captain to go into the Fore-caſtle, and take his Book and blot out all the names of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders,</hi> and, in their place, to inſert abundance of other names: After which, they looked it over, and found fault with ſome names that remained unaltered, ſaying, <hi>They were too well known;</hi> ſo hee put other ſtrange names in their rooms. Then they examined it again the third time, and found ſome names that they thought were too well known in <hi>England;</hi> ſo hee daſht out their names, and put in others in their rooms; and then cauſed them, after the third time of Examination, to bee written out fair.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40135:37"/> And hee ſaith, That the Purſers Book that is now to bee ſeen, is that which is written out fair, ſince the three alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Original Book, by blotting out ſeveral <hi>Hollanders</hi> names; the original blotted Book being not to bee found.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There were 4 barrs of Silver (as they lay at <hi>Eriff)</hi> brought out of the Hold; and by reaſon they were too big to bee carried away, they were put into a barrel of ſalt by the Steers-man and another: three of which barrs are yet aboard, for want of an opportunity to convey them a ſhore; but the fourth is carried a ſhore.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When the Silver was taken in at <hi>Cales,</hi> they agreed to ſign ſeveral Bills of Lading for <hi>Oſtend,</hi> though they were conſigned to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> (as is well known to the above-ſaid <hi>Joachim Peeſler);</hi> for hee heard Laders themſelvs ſay at <hi>Cales,</hi> That though the Bills of Lading were ſigned for <hi>Oſtend,</hi> yet the Silver was to bee ſent to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hee ſaith, That at <hi>Cales</hi> hee would have been freed from the ſhip <hi>Sampſon;</hi> for that the Maſter would not tell him to what place hee was bound: whereupon the Maſter told him, That if hee would go for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> hee might continue his ſervice aboard; for that the ſhip ſhould firſt go for <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> but afterwards hearing of the Warrs between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the Maſter told him they were bound for <hi>Oſtend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hee ſaith, That out of the <hi>Elias,</hi> and two other ſhips, (of which were Maſters, <hi>Claes Peterſon,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Ferrine,</hi> all belonging to <hi>Holland)</hi> ſeveral parcels of ſilver were brought aboard the <hi>Sampſon</hi> in <hi>Cales</hi> road, and remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when ſhee was taken by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Joachim</hi> being aboard the <hi>Elias,</hi> when the ſilver was thence ſent aboard the <hi>Sampſon.</hi>

                     <p> 7. Hee ſaith, That the Steers-man, <hi>Peter Naut</hi> brought on ſhore from the ſhip <hi>Sampſon</hi> a parcel of ſilver, about the bigneſs of a large Sugar loaf, which they well knew did belong to one <hi>Daniel Ferrine,</hi> a Maſter of a ſhip in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi>

                     <p>This quarrel did ariſe upon the Confeſsion of <hi>Joachim Peeſler</hi> (Chirurgeon of the ſhip <hi>Sampſon)</hi> when <hi>Otto George,</hi> the Captain of the Ship <hi>Sampſon,</hi> had heard that hee had diſcovered the truth for the State, concerning the altering of the Dutch Bils of lading in this Ship; and <hi>Otto George</hi> and the Spaniards malice was ſo great to <hi>Joachim Peeſler</hi> for making this diſcovery, that (I have heard it credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) they poiſoned him ſhortly after, and then reported hee died of the French Pox.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Jacob Elaes</hi> teſtefieth, that ſo ſoon as they came into the <note place="margin">Without all doubt, theſe Papers that were flung in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, were the true and original Bills of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding made in <hi>Spain.</hi>

                     <p>YEſterday, being the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1652. I <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery Faircliffe</hi> a Waiter for the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> houſe, on board the Great <hi>Sampſon,</hi> now riding at <hi>Eriffe,</hi> had ſome diſcourſ with the Cooks mate, who told mee, hee intended to com up to the Captain of the ſaid Ship, as this day, who (ſaid hee) is in <hi>London,</hi> to ask him for ſom money; and that if hee would not give him money as hee had given other folk, <hi>viz.</hi> the Steerſman, the Scrivan, the Gunner, the Cooper, and <hi>Jacob</hi> the Cabine Boy, and many others; that then hee would go up to the <hi>States,</hi> and diſcover ſo much as would make the goods and Ship Prize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and would declare no more then what hee had heard with his ears and ſeen with his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Hee ſaid, hee heard the Boatſwain ſpeak to the Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man between Deck, and ſaid if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship did meet with them, and knew that the Silver was <hi>Holland</hi> goods, they would take it for Prize. And the Steerſman did make anſwer, ſo they would, and the Ship too. And another ſtanding by ſaid, the Ship was too great to go into <hi>Oſtend: To whom hee anſwered, that they intended to lie without till the Boyers came from</hi> Holland <hi>to fetch away the Silver: and then the Ship being lighter they could go into</hi> Oſtend.</p>
                     <p>Hee ſaid alſo, that hee ſaw them where they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all the Silver, and that it lay a baſt the Maſte, but the Ship ſwimming too much by the Sterne, they brought a great deal of the ſilver and laid it on both ſides before the Maſte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And hee further told mee, that all the Silver is</hi> Hollands <hi>goods and more of the other goods, as Hides.</hi> And when hee had ſo ſaid, <hi>Peter</hi> the Boy came in and interrupted us, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40135:43"/> I had known more of his minde at that time.</p>

                     <hi>John Corbet</hi>'s Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody (hee being one of the Committee for <hi>Salop,)</hi> three of my Bonds of 2000 pounds, for the Payment of one Thouſand Pounds to mee <hi>Thomas Violet;</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> never received Penny for them. Whereupon, I have Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his <hi>Highneſs</hi> and the <hi>Counſel of State</hi> for theſe three Bonds (as part of my ſatisfaction) and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Corbet</hi> hath been ſent to by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Scobell,</hi> and was with the Committee Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and confeſſed that hee had the Bonds, and that the <hi>State</hi> never received Penny of them. This, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Corbet</hi> told my Lord <hi>Strickland</hi> and Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and that hee would deliver them unto mee if hee had the <hi>Counſels</hi> Order. I have likewiſe Petitioned the <hi>Counſel,</hi> that, for the preſent, I might have five hundred pounds, in part of my ſatisfaction; which money I laid out in the Proſecution of the ſilver Ships, <hi>Sampſon, Salvador, and George.</hi> And this I have proved upon the Oaths of Five men: And D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Walker</hi> and the Commiſsioners for Prize goods have ſent theſe <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits</hi> up to the <hi>Counſel</hi> for my ſatisfaction. And theſe <hi>Certificates</hi> and <hi>Affidavits</hi> remain ſealed together in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Jeſſop</hi>'s cuſtody. And I had the <hi>Counſel of States</hi> faithfull promiſe (but chiefly and above all, I relyed upon Your <hi>Honor</hi> for the Reſtoration of my Eſtate or the Value) the <hi>Parlament</hi> having taken from mee to the value of above E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven Thouſand Pounds in Houſes, Lands, Bonds, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and Offices; when by Gods law nor the law of this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40135:48"/> Nation, at the time when they took away my Eſtate, I had not forfeited one penny. If it had not been for my proteſting againſt the Diſcharge of the Silver, and my proſecution of that buſineſs, the Silver had all been let ſlip out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I moſt humbly beeſeech your Honor to acquaint M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Scobell</hi> of my ſeverall ſervices; and defire him, that hee bee carefull to draw up my order for my bonds, that I may bee enabled to ſue and proſecute them, as freely, as if they had never been under Sequeſtration. And that I may have, for the preſent, my monies I have expended in this ſervice againſt the Silver Ships. It is a lamentable Caſe, my Uſage, for mee to bring the <hi>State</hi> nere four Hundred Thouſand Pounds, And to bee put to Petition for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies I laid out of my purſ. At the <hi>Counſel of States,</hi> and at Doctor <hi>Walkers</hi> Entreaty, I imployed people to do this ſervice, as <hi>I</hi> can make it appear under his hand. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (I humbly conceiv) is not to bee matched, I having done ſo good Service, and been ſo ill requited. (It will make all men afraid to truſt to <hi>Engliſh States mens</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.) If I would have betrayed my truſt, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (I take God to witneſs) I was ſeveral times offered ten thouſand Pounds of ſome of the Claimers of this Silver: Which had I done it, I need not either to have ſtayed in this Country, or to have petitioned for my Bonds or Charges.</p>

               <hi>For this his Juſtice in certifying the Truth, I give his Honor moſt humble thanks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Preſented this Letter and Certificate to ſom of the Honorable Council; who, when they had read it, replyed, They wondred my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State did not give mee ſatisfaction when I did this ſervice; ſaying, They could have done it: and (if they would) they might have kept their promiſe; they then had power enough to do it.</p>
            <p>TO which I humbly anſwer; My agreement with the Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and the Council of State was, That I ſhould bee paid eleven thouſand pounds for this ſervice, out of the firſt moneies the State coyned of the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in theſe ſhips, after I ſhould by good and legal witneſs diſprove the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Claim; Or I ſhould bee reſtored to my eſtate in Offices, Lands, Bonds, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Houſes the Parlament had taken from mee, with all my dammage. <hi>Now</hi> (may it pleaſ your Highneſs) <hi>neither the Lord</hi> Bradſhaw <hi>nor the Council, all the time after</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:40135:49"/> 
               <hi>their agreement with mee, could pay mee; neither did I deſire it, before it was due; for I was to bee paid my monies out of the ſame monies which were then aboard the Ships:</hi> For although by my diſcovery and proteſt, the Councill of <hi>State</hi> ſtayed the ſilver; which was the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1652. Yet all the time after of the Parlament and Council of States ſitting, which was to the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1653. the ſuit againſt theſe ſilver ſhips and their ſilver and lading went on in the Admiraltie; and my witneſſes ſome of them examined in the Admiraltie, though many other witneſſes I would have examined more then I did get to bee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but could not have them. And there was no publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation till after the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1653. and then the power of the Old Council of State was taken from them, and the ſilver (though ſtayed all that time, from <hi>December</hi> 1652. to <hi>April</hi> 1653.) remained a ſhip board, though both the Commiſſiones for Prize Goods, and my ſelf often times, made the Council of State acquainted with the daily Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilments of the Silver in theſe ſhips.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> Upon the diſſolving of that Parlament and Council of State, I received new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and directions from your <hi>Highneſs's</hi> moſt honorable Counſel, commanding mee to proceed and preſent to them all frauds and abuſes concerning this ſilver. And when I preſented to your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Counſel my humble deſires, and told them what agreement I had made with the Old Counſel of State, which was, That I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv twelv pence upon every twenty ſhillings which was paid to the State out of theſe ſilver ſhips for my diſcovery, till the ſumm of eleven thouſand pounds was paid mee.</p>
            <p>After I had attended your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Counſel ſeveral daies for my Anſwer, the right honorable Colonel <hi>Sidenham</hi> and Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> (for Anſwer to my humble Petition for the ſaid Allowance) told mee, the Councils pleaſure was, and they required mee in the Councils name to proceed, and that I ſhould have from the Council all my charges,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40135:49"/> and an honorable Reward for my pains and hazzard, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and time, both for thoſe I emploied and for myſelf, if I did diſproov the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Claim to the ſilver aboard the <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George;</hi> and other particular Agreement your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Council would not make with your Supplicant; for Colonel <hi>Sidenham</hi> and Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> told mee, It was below the Council to make any other Agreement: and of the juſt performance of this, I might reſt aſſured on.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> Till I had this promiſe from your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Council, I would proceed no further, but refrained my Attendance on Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> (hee ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for mee earneſtly to proceed, both by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Doreſlaus</hi> and others) I told them, when the Counſel of State had given mee their anſwer, how I ſhould bee reſtored to my eſtate, and receiv ſatisfaction for my disburſments I had and ſhould lay out in this ſervice, I would then proceed in this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>And upon the right honorable Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sidenham</hi>'s promiſe to mee as aforeſaid, and upon Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Walker</hi>'s earneſt intreaty of mee (as appears under his hand) I proceeded in this ſervice. And this was done ſince your <hi>Highneſs</hi> took the Government, by order and command of your Council of State, and at the entreaty of your Advocate Doctor <hi>Walker.</hi> And upon theſe honorable Promiſes (beſides my former Agreement with the Old Council of State) I relyed and proceeded; whereupon, Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> gave mee ſeveral Warrants to the Regiſter, to the Examiner, and to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Let the Judges of the Admiraltie ſay what they pleaſ, This was a great help and incouragement unto mee in my Diſcoveries, and made my work ſo much the eaſier when I found his vigilancy and integrity to improve by all lawful waies and means the Common-wealths intereſt to this Silver, that they ſhould not bee couſoned of this great Treaſure.

And the Common-wealth and your Highneſs, by my proteſt and careful proſecution, got every penny of the ſilver in theſe ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> which elſ your Highneſs and the Common-wealth had loſt.

            <p>UPpon what is here ſworn and atteſted by able legall Witneſſes, I do moſt humbly appeal to Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Whether I did not deal with the Counſel of State and the Committee for Forrain affaires, and Your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>'s Counſell as publick Miniſters in the name and behalf, of the Commonwealth: And that, (if I had not relied on their honorable Promiſs, and ſince, on Your Highnes's Counſell; whether I would have run theſe hazards, been at this Charge, hiered half a ſcore ſeveral perſons, and to have ſpent five hundred pounds, and payed Intereſt for it till this day, if I had not had the aſſurance from the State, of juſt and honorable dealing) <hi>the Lord</hi> Bradſhawe, <hi>nor any one of the old</hi> Counſel of State <hi>were privately intereſſed in this buſineſs, with agreeing with mee for the reſtoring of my Eſtate, or the ſumme of Eleven Thouſand Pounds, if I did diſprove the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſadors and the</hi> Spaniards <hi>Claims, they were not, nor none of their relations were to have one penny or farthing benefit by this agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They did onely look upon the greatneſs of my ſervice and the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:40135:57"/> 
               <hi>charge and difficulty I ſhould undergo: And ſome of the</hi> Counſell of State <hi>told mee, If I did prove what I undertook, I deſerved forty thouſand Pounds,</hi> for I ſaved the State all the Three hundred thouſand pounds: <hi>But if I ſhould faile in what I had undertaken, I deſerved to loſe my life: And that, if I would bee ſo raſh, to make a Proteſt againſt the diſcharge of the Silver, and, when I had done, could not prove it, I muſt ſuffer highly for it,</hi> for it was at that time to bring more fiſts about their ears then the State could well defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from. Many of the Counſel of State, and ſome of the Commiſſioners for Prize goods and Officers of the Mint told mee, <hi>I had undone my ſelf if I did not prove, there was great quantitie of ſilver in theſe Ships,</hi> Sampſon, Salvador <hi>and</hi> George, <hi>belonged to the</hi> Dutch <hi>in the</hi> United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>Many great Perſonages told mee, The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador would demand Juſtice on mee for preſuming to contradict what ſo great a Princes Ambaſſador affirmed to the Counſell of State, and to the Parlament, if I failed of my proofs againſt him.</p>
            <p>Alſo, the Merchants, many ſcores of them would have their actions againſt mee, for their Damages, for my detaining their ſhips and ſilver upon a fall pretence, (they having enterred a Proteſt for their Dammage in <hi>December</hi> 1652, for detaining this ſilver.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And, above all, ſome of the</hi> Councel of State <hi>told mee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if I could not prove what I had alledged to bee true, I ſhould bee taken for an Incendiary (and ſo they would report mee to the</hi> Parlament?) So that, in ſeeking to get mine Eſtate, I ran a great hazzard totally to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe Your</hi> Highneſs: <hi>In brief, I might with the ſame ſecurity have as well flung my ſelf off of</hi> Paul's <hi>Steeple, as to have miſſed to maintain my charge, and not have diſproved the</hi> Spaniſh Ambaſſadors Claim.</p>
            <p>Therefore when I had made my Proteſt in the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I was forced to bee at the Charge to make out my Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40135:57"/> and Proofs, and then fully to follow this buſineſs, or bee undone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The proſecution of this buſineſs hath been to my inſupportable Charge: to this day I pay Intereſt for five hundred Pounds I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, and laid out in this buſineſs, to bring the</hi> State <hi>in above Three hundred thouſand Pounds, as appears formerly, uppon the Oaths of ſeverall credible Witneſſes.</hi> And although I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the ſumme of Eleven Thouſand pounds. <hi>Of all that ſumme I have received as yet (though I attended dayly the</hi> State) <hi>but three Bonds (which were my own Bonds) in two thouſand Pounds for the payment of one thouſand Pounds unto mee</hi> Thomas Violet: <hi>Theſe Bonds being ſeized, and taken out of my ſiſters cuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And theſe Bonds I could not haue out of the <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Salops</hi> Cuſtody, till I paid them forty Pounds, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Order of the <hi>Counſel</hi> following.

This was about <hi>March</hi> 1653</p>
            <p>This (that before I have humbly declared) ſhews to all the world the juſt grounds and reaſons the then Parlament and Counſel of State had for ſtaying the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vador,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> upon your humble and faithfull Subjects diſcovery, and his Proteſt in the Court of Admiraltie, and his great expence and paines: All which hee willingly and cheerfully undertook, to ſhew his true affection to his dear Countrey, to the then Parlament and Counſel of State, and afterwards to your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> by ſeveral Orders and Warrants from your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Counſel, and your <hi>Highneſs</hi>'s Advocate, requiring and deſiring your Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to do this: And no man of his Condition can ſhew fuller or clearer demonſtration of his duty and love to his Nation and the preſent Supreme Governors; Nor no man in <hi>England</hi> (of your Supplicants condition) ever brought to the Common-wealth ſo much money at one time, as your Supplicant hath done.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The tree is known by his fruit:</hi> Had I not loved my Countrey, I would not have ventured my life and eſtate (as I have done) in this ſervice, and ſate up nights and daies to do this ſervice, and imploied half a ſcore perſons at my own charge in this Buſineſs.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40135:61"/>
            <p>I moſt humbly here (upon my knees) preſent your HIGHNESS an Accompt of what hath been taken from mee <hi>Thomas Violet;</hi> for which I moſt humbly deſire ſatisfaction in kinde, with my dammages, or the ſumm of eleven thouſand pounds, as was faithfully promiſed unto mee by the moſt honorable Counſel of State in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> and <hi>January</hi> 1652. for ſtaying the Silver in the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and diſproving the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Claim to this Silver, which was above three hundred thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHen I was firſt ſent unto the Tower the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1643, my mother had of mine good Bonds and Bills in her hands taken away from her at ſeveral times, to the value of one thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and odd pounds; Beſides many of my Papers and Accompts of great concernment to the Commonwealth; and as yet I cannot come to the knowledg who hath them: But this I am ſure of, If there had been any thing in them that could have made againſt mee, there had then uſe been made of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My mother had at another time a Privy Seal taken from her, wherein the late King acknowledged hee owed me (for my expences in diſcovering the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver) ninteen hundred threeſcore and eight pounds: which money I laid every penny out of my
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40135:61"/> own purſe to do the late King and Commonwealth that ſervice: and I cauſed the tranſporters of gold and ſilver to be fined in the Star Chamber at <hi>Twenty four Thouſand pounds,</hi> beſides ſeveral Merchants, and gold and ſilver Refiners, <hi>viz.</hi> Alderman <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Gibbs,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Peter Fountain</hi> and others: Upon their Petition to the late King, (and paying well for it) had their Pardon under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for ſeveral abuſes practiſed by them in their Trades, and complained of at <hi>Whitehall</hi> to the late King by <hi>Sr Henry Mildemay</hi> Maſter of the Jewel-houſ, and by ſom of the Wardens and Company of <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> as will appear by the Order of the <hi>Counſel-table,</hi> 25 Jan. 1634.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Committee of <hi>Eſſex</hi> put mee out of Poſſeſsion of the Mannors of <hi>Battells</hi> and <hi>Patan-Hall</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as appears by their Warrants. Of which Lands I had an Extent to the juſt value of One thouſand pounds: and one <hi>Mr Elcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> received my rents ever ſince 1643, <hi>Mr Philip Cage</hi> being in poſſeſsion for my Uſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Committee of <hi>Shropſhire</hi> ſeized, in my ſiſters hands, in <hi>London,</hi> three Bonds due to mee, in two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for the payment to mee <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> one thouſand pounds, by the Lady <hi>Anne Waad, Edmond Lenthal, Phillip Cage</hi> and <hi>Charles Mordent</hi> Eſq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s, as appears by the Bonds reſtored unto mee back from <hi>John Corbet</hi> Eſq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1656, by vertue of your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and your Counſels Order of 21 of <hi>March</hi> 1655. And I have put theſe Bonds in ſuit, according to the power given unto me by your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and your moſt honorable <hi>Counſel:</hi> For which Juſtice I moſt humbly am bound to give to Colonel <hi>Syddenham,</hi> my Lord <hi>Strickland,</hi> and Col. <hi>Jones</hi> moſt humble thanks; humbly truſting in God, that they will bee honorably pleaſed to move your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Councel</hi> to take that order, the reſt of my Eſtate under Sequeſtration ſhall bee juſtly reſtored: Or, that I ſhall have the ſumm to bee made up Eleven thouſand pounds paid mee, according to the faithfull promiſe of the <hi>Councel of State</hi> 1652, for ſtaying,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40135:62"/> and intituling the <hi>State</hi> to the aforeſaid Three hundred thouſand pounds in ſilver, which the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> (onely by my means,) had every penny of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I had the Leaſ of ten ſeverall Houſes, at the <hi>Poſterne</hi> in <hi>Little Moor-fields;</hi> and the Tennants owed mee, when I was committed to the Tower, in arrears for rent above one hundred pounds: And for theſe <hi>Thirteen</hi> years, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Rent of them. But one <hi>Mr Elconhead</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Rents of them ever ſince.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>I had the Office of ſealing and ſurveying of all gold and ſilver Thread and Wyer: which prevented the making of all ſleight and adulterate gold and ſilver Thread, and Wyer, granted to mee under the Great Seal, for three Lives, from the late King; which Office coſt mee Fifteen hundred Pounds (to the Lord Treaſurer</hi> Juxon, <hi>L.</hi> Cottington, <hi>Sr</hi> John Cook <hi>Secretary of State, and Sr.</hi> John Bankes <hi>the late Kings Attourney. The neceſſity of keeping up that Office, to prevent the dayly Coſennages and frauds of divers Silkmen, Wyerdrawers and Refiners in their making Courſ, ſleight and deceitfull Gold and Silver Wyer and Toread: I ſhall at the later end of this book ſhew at large; having about three hundred Aſſayes of adulterate and courſ gold and ſilver Wyer, Thread, Spangles, Oes,</hi> &amp;c <hi>all made and ſold contrary to the Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Theſe Aſſayes are in my cuſtody, under the Hand and Attestation of Mr</hi> Alexander Jackſon <hi>Aſſay-maſter of Goldſmiths Hall; and the ſeveral Silkmens names and ſhops, and dayes of the Moneth in which they ſold this courſ, adulterate gold and ſilver Thread and Lace, Spangles, Wyer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the great deceipt of the</hi> Nation <hi>in generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And, upon the Diſcovery of theſe notorious Cheats, the late King and his Counſel appointed mee</hi> Surveyor <hi>and</hi> Sealer <hi>of the ſaid Manufacture.) I cauſed all the abuſes to bee laid aſide: I Indicted ſom offenders, impriſoned ſom, cauſed others to ſtand in the Pillory, and made many of them that wrought adulterate courſ ſilver run away out of</hi> London: <hi>By which means I angred many cheating Wyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawers, Silkmen and Refiners: and the late Kings</hi> Councel <hi>and</hi> Commiſsioners <hi>ſetled ſuch Rules and Orders, during that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40135:62"/> 
               <hi>the Manufacture was all made of good ſilver, and the Coin and Bullion of this Nation preſerved; and your Supplicant was bound, to the late King, to warrant all the Manufactures either of gold or ſilver, Wyer or Thread which hee ſealed, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in the Office, to bee good ſilver, and to make it good to any party grieved in the Nation; as appears by my Patent under the Great Seal of</hi> England. For which Aſſurance, Surveying and Sealing, I was allowed to demand and take an half penny for every once Troy, in Wyer, Spangles, Oes, ctc. I ſuveyed; and 4 pence for every pound weight Vennice, for all the Gold and Silver I ſealed with the Seal of my Office, being the Roſe and Crown.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I had a Grant from the late King, under his Signet, to bee Maſter-worker of the <hi>Mint</hi> in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> for my life, with the Fee of five hundred pound a year, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting that place; which Grant was taken from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of her Cuſtody, when I was ſent to the Tower.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I had one quarter part of the Lady <hi>Willers</hi> Farm at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſ,</hi> for the Importation of all gold and ſilver Thread, Hatbands, Lace, and Copper thread throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> which coſtmee, a little before I was ſequeſtred, above ſeven hundred pounds. And if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gold and ſilver thread was put down in <hi>England,</hi> the Cuſtom of gold and ſilver thread imported would make a far greater Revenew then now it doth by the Exciſe; and the manifacture, if it bee made here, ought to bee kept to a ſtrict Regulation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I ſpent in my Impriſonment in the Tower for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt four years above ſeven hundred pounds; and could never get to be heard, though I petitioned to the Parlament, as aforeſaid, many years, to come to a Triall, knowing my ſelf to bee innocent both by God's Law and the Laws of the Land; and above all, by the teſtimony of a good Conſcience, which hath ever ſupported mee in and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all theſe troubles. All this Eſtate was and is Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40135:63"/> (but my three aforeſaid bonds) to this day; beſides my Dammage for my four years Impriſonment.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Since I came out of the Tower, by order of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> of State 1652. and ſince I laid out (in the Proſecution of the ſilver Ships, <hi>Sampſon Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George)</hi> above the ſumm of five hundred pounds, as appears by the Oaths of ſeverall perſons which I emploied in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, (as you may ſee in this book, <hi>Fol.</hi> 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55.)

And at that time</hi> (viz. <hi>in</hi> December 1643.) <hi>there was ſent and came from</hi> Oxford <hi>the Writs weekly under the Great Seal of</hi> England <hi>without any Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: My hard uſage After-ages will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev, had I not Printed it to Poſterity.]</hi>

            <p>I Sufferd Impriſonment in the <hi>Tower</hi> almoſt four years, for bringing up the aforeſaid Letter from <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Lord Mayor and Common Council of the City of <hi>London</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1643 although I had an Order from the Houſ of Commons (as appears by their Journal Book) and a Paſs from the Lord General <hi>Eſſex</hi> to go to <hi>Oxford;</hi> which were both procured for mee by <hi>Mr Theophilus Ryley,</hi> Scout-maſter General of the City of <hi>London,</hi> who was authorized to execute that place by the then Parlament and Common Council of <hi>London;</hi> and I was authorized by the ſaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And alſo the Committee of both Nations was made acquainted with my going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the bringing up the ſaid Letter which I brought from the late King (by Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> Knight, I deſired him to make them acquainted therewith, before ever I went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to have their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;) which Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> (after hee had ſpoken with them) told mee, I had their approbation to go to <hi>Oxford:</hi> And all this was done before any Law or Ordinance was made or declared to forbid mee or any other to do the ſame (that ever I heard of:) And I humbly ſay, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a law made, there is no tranſgreſſion, neither by Gods law nor Mans law.

               <p>PEradventure ſome (upon the ſight of this Act) may alledg, this Statute was made in the Reign of a weak and unfortunate Prince, to reſtrain the diſorders of his Houſ, and to bring to Juſtice evil Counſellers; and will ſay, <hi>God bee thanked, wee have a wiſe and victorious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and a provident and frugal Counſel, and provident Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Miniſters under them:</hi> I grant this a truth, and I thank God for it. But this I humbly ſay, Amongſt the exacteſt model that ever was upon earth (which was <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Diſciples) there was a <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt the twelv. May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> (upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of the Tranſactions of the long Parlament, concerning money matters, ſome particular members with ſome of their Committees, and many of their Agents, and many great perſons imploied in the Common-wealth, at this very day) there will appear to your <hi>Highneſs</hi> above one <hi>Judas</hi> in twelv, taking in all that were members of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with their Committees and Agents, ſome of them being in great places of Truſt at this day; Many of them being provident Theevs, getting from the bottom of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and beggerie, by fraud, diſsimulation and cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in every Countie, Citie and Corner of the Nation, vaſt and great poſſeſsions, both in money, lands and goods. Many of theſe men being near of kin and condition to the <hi>Unjuſt Steward</hi> in the Goſpel, who (when his Lord called him to accompt, becauſ hee could not dig nor delve) joins with his Lords Debtors to cozen his Lord and Maſter; and this is the true ſtare of this Buſineſs. Upon the peril of my life, this your <hi>Highneſs</hi> will finde to bee the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (upon examination) of many members in the long Parlament, many Committee-men, many Farmors of the Cuſtoms, many Commiſsioners for Delinquents Lands, many Purchaſers of Lands, many Excize-men, many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners for Prize-Goods, and many other perſons of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40135:77"/> all callings and conditions that have had imploiment for the publick, and have fingred the publick Treaſure ever ſince the year 1640. of every condition great numbers, who (amongſt them) have ſtoln and cozened the Common-wealth of above twenty millions of money.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſ your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> I have ever eſteemed that man a bad Bailiff or Steward, that deſires to keep a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie and correſpondencie with his Lords Tennants and Debtors, that ſo they may keep their Landlord and Maſter in ignorance, never to know the value of his eſtate, nor when nor how to make his improvement; but when ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties fall, to pocket up the profits themſelvs, and defraud their Lord, and keep him alwaies poor, that ſo they may bee alwaies held uſefull and neceſſary by their Lords and Maſters, when indeed they are but jugling Knaves, and are the bain and diſhonor of their Lord and Maſter both in his Eſtate and Reputation: <hi>I moſt humbly ſay, that if there bee any againſt the diſcovery of theſe Abuſes, your Highneſs will (upon examination finde them parties or near of affinity to them that have cozened your Highneſs and the Common-wealth.</hi> I humbly upon my knees beg your <hi>Highneſs's</hi> pardon for theſe my plain and loial expreſsions, which proceed from the heart of one that daily praies to God for your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>'s peace, ſafetie and proſperitie.</p>

My humble <hi>Quere</hi> to you is, <hi>Whether this is not a fraudulent Act of any Treaſurer, Commiſsioner of the Excize, Cuſtom-houſ, and Drury-houſ, or any other publick Treaſurer of the Nation, and every ſuch Treaſurer puniſhable, if hee deliver in unto the State the full ſumm of</hi> 6000l. <hi>when in truth hee hath paid poor</hi> J.

And this I humbly deſire your judgments in (for a greater or leſſer ſumm); and if I ſhall prove one or more Treaſurers guiltie of the aforeſaid offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether you by your Commiſsion are impowered to give mee a full fifth part for my diſcovery of all ſuch ſumms of money I ſhall cauſe to bee paid in to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer touching the premiſſes?</p>

               <p>AT the beginning of our late troubles, ſome men (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſigned unto themſelves to make themſelves great in the midſt of the common Calamities, and to fiſh in troubled waters) diſturbed the moſt excellent courſ of the Exchequer; and (to compaſs their fraudulent deſigns which they had craftily laid) erected Private Treaſuries, as Goldſmiths hall, <hi>Gourney</hi> houſ, <hi>Worceſter</hi> houſ, Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhershall, Weavers hall, <hi>Drury</hi> houſ, Cuſtom houſ, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Office, Treaſuries for the Publique Plate of the <hi>Nation</hi> at Guild hall, and infinite other places throughout this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were erected, and pettie Exchequers, where the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique monie was kept; and the publique Accounts by that means interwooven one with another; and almoſt all of them managed by perſons equally guilty, and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively covetous, as well City Commiſſioners and Treaſures, as Country Commiſsioners and Treaſurers. So that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Clarks and ſlight fellows being crept into imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to finger the publique monies, ſome, by buying of the Goldſmiths light and clipped monies, and then puting the ſaid light and clipped monies amongſt the publique Treaſure. (It was obſerved by all that paid moneis in to the Treaſurers, that the Tellers would not receiv a clipped ſhilling, and when they paid it away for the <hi>State,</hi> their Payments were full of clipped money, which clipped money they bought of Goldſmiths, to the value of many
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40135:88"/> ſcore of thouſand pounds, and this was twenty times cull'd over and over, and now they are fain to take it in the Country, or to receiv none: The clipped monie was like a horſ in a mill, it went round; the Treaſurers would receive none, but bought it of the Goldſmith, the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths would melt no clipped money they bought, but ſell it to the Treaſurers and Caſhiers; this was paid to the Army, they paid it for their Quarters, the Farmer payes it to his Landlord, the Landlord brings it up to <hi>London</hi> and ſells it to the Goldſmith at 15l, 20l, 25l in the hundred loſs, thinking it is melted, and hee ſhall never more bee tronbled with it: but the Goldſmith ſells it, as aforeſaid; and at my Gentleman's next quarter payment his money is paid him again: ſo that the <hi>Nation</hi> (by this trick) hath been mightily cheated by publick Caſhiers: and they have many of them gotten great Eſtates, ſome Five thouſand, ſome Ten thouſand, ſome Fifteen thouſand, ſome Twenty thouſand, ſome Thirty thouſand, ſome Forty thouſand Pounds apiece: And if theſe pettie Varlets, which were but ſervants and underlings, have gotten ſuch vaſte and great Eſtates by their craftie and fraudulent actions, being but young ſucklings, in compariſon of many of the great Treaſurers their maſters; what have theſe great Treaſurers then gotten, whoſe ravening paunches have devoured the wealth and ſubſtance of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it pleaſe your</hi> Highneſs, <hi>I could name them by ſcores, but that I forbear at preſent, till Juſtice do perſonally ſingle them out; for in every County, City, Corporation, and almoſt in every Pariſh in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>there is very few Pariſhes in the</hi> Nation <hi>without ſome of theſe Unjuſt Stewards, Committee-men, Sequeſtrators, and Treaſurers.

                  <hi>to have the publick monies in his hands, as was ſaid to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Steward in the Goſpel,</hi> How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an accompt of thy Stewardſhip, for thou mayeſt bee no longer Steward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your</hi> Highneſs <hi>and the Parlament may ſee, by the former reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Laws and Statutes, what care all former ages had to ſee the Kings Debts and Rents duely paid and accompted for; and that no fraud ſhould bee put upon them, their Heirs or Succeſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To prevent all frauds, moſt excellent Waies and Rules were ſetled in the Court of Exchequer, in all Kings Reigns, by the great care of many Ages: And the Sages of the Law know, there was not a more exact method in the world, then the Court of Exchequer was, for the juſt accompting and paying the Kings Dues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have heard my Lord</hi> Cottington <hi>ſay in the Exchequer Chamber, That no Prince in Chriſtendom had the like exact way, as the King of</hi> England <hi>had, by the courſe of the Exchequer, if the Rules ſet down by the Court bee by the under-Officers duely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: ſo that whatſoever ſumm comes in there, (bee it a million of money) muſt bee duely paid and accompted for, or elſe hee could finde it upon the foot of the accompt, if ever it came in charge into the Pipe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if the courſe of the Exchequer had not been diſturbed, and the payments of the publick money thruſt out of the old Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, it had been impoſsible to have had ſo many Treaſurers cozen the Common-wealth ſo groſly and ſhamefully as they have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in order and purſuance of calling all Accomptants to a juſt, true and ſtrickt Accompt, your Supplicant moſt humbly preſents theſe enſuing Propoſals to your</hi> Highneſs <hi>and the Parlaments view and conſideration; and humbly prayeth, that the ſame may bee put in ſtrickt execution, with ſuch alterations and additions as your</hi> Highneſs <hi>and the Parlament ſhall conceive fitteſt for the good of the Nation in general, to eaſe the people of their Taxes.

               <p>And, what Service I have don to this <hi>Nation,</hi> I moſt humbly leav it to the conſiderations of all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men.

               <p>And the Refiners (Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> and Alderman <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton,</hi> by their craft) getting to bee great with the Attorney General <hi>Bankes,</hi> Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courtiers, got to bee the onely men to carry on this Project, for being the Kings Agents to furniſh One hundred thouſand pounds a year for this manufacture. And the late King (to gratifie the Refiners who had bid him ſo roundly) granted Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> and Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> their pardons under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> (the reſt of the Refiners being then but young men, were eſteemed as raſcal Deer, they had not wool on their Backs, nor had committed ſins enough for to have their pardons under the great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo got diſmiſſed by Order of the Lords of the Counſel in the Court of <hi>Starr-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

               <p>The Duty reſerved to the King in lieu of his Cuſtoms, was nothing ſo odious to the Wyer-drawers (in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon) as the Refiners Monopoly was. The Wyer-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conſtantly affirmed to the King and his Counſel, and to the Kings Commiſſioners, that the Refiners Monopoly was contrary to Law; and upon a diſpute at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell Table, the King called the Refiners (Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> and Alderman <hi>Wollaſton)</hi> his Sheep, and the Wyerdrawers he called his Goats; (but in the concluſion both theſe Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aldermen proved the Kings Majeſties Sheep biters:) And the late King preſſed the Wyer-drawers at his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell Table to conform themſelvs to the Regulation; but ſome of the Wyer-drawers told the ſaid King, They would ſubmit to the Law, but not to the Refiners Monopoly; and that it was againſt the Law, that Freemen of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould bee reſtrained a Free Market, to enrich

And the Goldwyerdrawers paid this for divers years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is well known to many hundred perſons in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon, the Wyer-drawers petitioned againſt this Monopoly of Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> and Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> to the Parlament in 1640. and therein ſet forth that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly was contrary to the Common Law, and againſt the Statute of 21. <hi>Jac.</hi> concerning Monopolies; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Liberties of the City of <hi>London;</hi> And that this monopoly was for the exceſsive profit of the Refiners, for that they could buy their ſilver at a moneths time 3 pence an ounce cheaper; then they were forced to pay the Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ready money: And this was affirmed in Parlament by <hi>Thomas Joles, Robert Patrickſon, Laurence Whalley, Nathanae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>l Seabourn,</hi> and ſeveral other Gold-wyer-drawers.</p>
               <p>Upon Examination of this Buſineſs by the Parlament, the Patentees (Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> Alderman <hi>Gibbs,</hi> &amp;c) were commanded to bring into the Houſ their Monopoly, and then the Wyer-drawers got quite free from it by Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the truth was, they accepted of being the Kings Agents for the ſole refining and vending of One hundred thouſand pounds ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a year for this Manufacture, out of a covetous deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelvs, and unjuſtly did exclude all Goldſmiths and Wyer-drawers that had ſerved their time to the Trade; and by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this Monopoly, they got their Pardons under the great Seal of</hi> England <hi>for many great, as may appear upon view of their Pardons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they were ſued in the <hi>Starr-Chamber,</hi> it is very true: For ſuch Crimes, that had the Cauſe proceeded, and witneſſes then been examined, and the Court given Judgement againſt them, they had been both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>To my knowledg, this was their chief Plea in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo they flung dirt in the Kings face (for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie towards them) by their Petition which they preſented to the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Though before the Parlament, they would neither let Goldſmiths nor the Wyer-drawers to have a free market; but ſtiffly inſiſted on it, ever when it came to a diſpute, That the Refining and preparing Gold and Silver wyer, did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely belong to the Refiners; and ſo excluded the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths of <hi>London:</hi> And by their Monopolie excluded all other perſons from the Trade, but onely eight perſons (the Kings Agents and Pattentees.

               <p>Several times this Monopolie of the Refiners was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and argued oftentimes at the Counſell Table, and before the King; Commiſsioners in <hi>Little Brittain,</hi> and at <hi>Mr</hi> Attornie General <hi>Bankes</hi> Chamber (both before Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Wollaſton</hi> and Ald. <hi>Gibbs</hi> got their Monopolie, and after they had their Pattent) ſome of the Wyer drawers and ſome of the Goldſmiths and Silkmen (chiefly Sir <hi>George Binion</hi> a Silkman, for the Silkmen; and the Wardens of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Goldſmiths, for the Goldſmiths; and all the chief Wyer-drawers, in behalf of themſelvs and their Fellow Wyer-drawers) oppoſing Sir <hi>John Wollaſton</hi> and Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> Monopolie, and deſiring to have a free market to buy their Silver.

               <p>For executing of my Office juſtlie and ſtrictlie, to hold the Refiners and Wyerdrawers to a Rule, to make all their wyer and thread of good ſilver, and puniſhing the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, manie of them I brought to Juſtice. And I ſhewed the King how hee was cozened in the Mint of Three thouſand Pounds a year <hi>(which cauſed Alderman</hi> Wollaſton <hi>ſecretly to hate mee mortally) And hee cauſed mee to bee clapt up (by his incenſing ſome members of Parlament againſt mee) in the Tower, in</hi> Januarie 1643. <hi>when hee was Lord Major of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>And the Parlament kept mee cloſe priſoner there Nine hundred twentie eight daies; and Fourteen Moneths more, in which I had libertie to go at large in the Tower; upon the pretence I was a Malignant, when the truth was, Alderman</hi> Wollaſton vented but his private malice againſt mee.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion <hi>viz.</hi> Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> having put up to the Parlament in the year 1640, a Petition, ſlighting the Kings mercie and goodneſs towards him, in giving him his Pardon; when I ſaw Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi>'s car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in that Petition hee preſented to the Parlament, I then told the King, in the year 1640. that Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> joining with ſome of the Officers of his Mint had made a fraudulent agreement to melt all the ſilver in the Mint, which was to make monies; and hee to have from the King the allowance of 16 grains upon the pound Troy, which is 2 pence the pound weight Troy, for all the ſilver hee melted in the Mint. This agreement was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either the King's or the Lords of the Counſells know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or approbation, nor was there anie allowance or power under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for him to receive theſe fees, or the Officers of the Mint to grant them to him.</p>
               <p>By which fraudulent bargain, the King was defrauded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40135:103"/> of neer upon three thouſand pounds a year, from the year 1630. to the year 1640. And Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> put up all this monie in his own particular purſe, the King nor Lords never knowing any thing of this blinde bargain.</p>
               <p>Alderman <hi>Wollaſtons</hi> place in the <hi>Tower</hi> being ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the eie of the State, and in the reputation of the world (the melter of the mint being but the Maſter work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſervant) that Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> never had a Patent for it under the Great Seal, whereas the Maſter worker of the Mint hath a Pattent; the Warden, the Aſſaie-maſter, the maſter of the Irons, the Engraver, the Comptroller, the Teller, and ſeveral other Officers of the Mint, have all of them their ſeveral Pattents under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for their ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>Now Alderman <hi>Wollaſton</hi>'s place was worth every year to him more monie then all the aforeſaid Officers of the Mint, twice told; for every year hee cleared near three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year, as I proved to the late King, and I can prove it to your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> the Parlament, and your Counſel, whenſoever you pleaſ: and all the Officers Fees in the Mint did not amount to one thouſand pounds a year. A ſtrange fraudulent trick, that a ſervant (for in the Mint Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman <hi>Wollaſton</hi> was but the maſter workers of the mints ſervant) ſhould get ſix times more then his maſter, and three times more then all the Officers in the mint: It was the profits of this Place raiſed him principally to bee an Alderman.</p>
               <p>But this is no great wonder, when the maſters of the mint (for many years) are and have been ignorant of the myſteries and perquiſites of their places, to the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Nation in many particulars. In former times it was not ſo; Goldſmiths and Artiſts were maſters of the mint, that knew the courſe of Exchanges, and held Correſpondence with Forrain Bankers and merchants: no Age can ſhew (afore this) a Doctor of Phyſick maſter worker of the mint; and had not I ſtopped at one time
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40135:104"/> three hundred thouſand pounds of ſilver, the Irons in the mint would have been ruſtie. I cauſed more money to come to the mint at one time (1653) then hath been coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſeven yeare beſides that money.</p>
               <p>Upon this my Information to the King, hee preſently ſent for <hi>Mr Andrew Palmer,</hi> the Aſſay-maſter of the mint, and <hi>Mr Henry Cogan,</hi> the Comptroller of the mint, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the buſineſs about Alderman <hi>Wollaſtons</hi> Place in the Tower, and commanded mee to bee by, and to declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them what I had told his Majeſtie concerning Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Wollaſtons</hi> Place of melter in the mint. And when they heard what I ſaid, they confeſſed it to bee a truth, that Alderman <hi>Wollaston</hi> had in ten years (beeing eſteemed but as a ſervant by the condition of his Place in the mint to the Head-Officers, the maſter Worker and Warden of the mint) gotten more by his melting of the Silver in the mint, then all the Officers of the mint (put them all together) had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon the King was wonderfull angry with them, (they beeing his Officers in the Mint,) that they would ſuffer ſuch a thing, and not acquaint him or his Counſel with it; And asked, If my Lord Treaſurer, or Lord</hi> Cottington, <hi>or the Lords of his Counſel allowed him to have ſuch Fees and allowances, or knew that</hi> Wollaſton <hi>made ſuch Gaines in the Mint, by being Melter of the Gold and Silver. They told his Majeſtie, No; they did believe none of them knew it, nor any others but the Officers of the Mint; for that it was a myſterie and few did know it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the King ſwor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And then the King ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſted. He would have an accompt &amp; ſatisfaction for this Buſineſs; And that hee would not allow Alderman</hi> VVollaſton <hi>Thirty thouſand pounds for that hee could have done for One thouſand pounds. This was about ten daies before the King went</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40135:104"/> 
                  <hi>from</hi> London, <hi>and had hee ever came again in peace, (in my conſcience) this buſineſs had been called to a ſtrickt accompt: and the King thereupon gave mee</hi> Thomas Violet <hi>the place of Maſter of the Mint, and to have the fee of five hundred pounds a year, And that I ſhould execute</hi> Alderman Wollaſtons <hi>place, of melter without any fee upon account of the Maſters fee and no more: I was to melt the Gold and Silver upon oath, not to have any benefit but only my fee of five hundred pound a year, as maſter worker of the Mint:</hi> Alderman Wollaſton <hi>came to hear of this buſineſs afterwards, (in all likelyhood) by Mr.</hi> Palmer <hi>or Mr.</hi> Cogan, <hi>and this was the true cauſe of Sr</hi> John Wollaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons <hi>getting mee to bee ſent to the Tower, when hee was Lord Maior of London.</hi> One other chief reaſon of my ſending to the Tower was; ſom Marchants of London and others (that had tranſported vaſt quantities of Gold and Silver out of the Nation, &amp; had melted down many ſcore thouſand pounds of heavy currant Engliſh money, for gold and Silver wyer and plate) finding that I was commanded by Mr <hi>Pym</hi> and Mr <hi>Hamden,</hi> and other honorable members of Parlament to attend the houſ, about paſſing an Act of Parlament in the houſ, to queſtion all ſuch as had tranſported Gold or Silver, without licence, (The order for my proſecution of this buſineſs againſt the Tranſporters of gold is in the Journal book of the Parlament, 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March 1640. As will thereby appear, and the ſeverall orders and tranſactions thereupon) Therefore the tranſporters of Gold and Silver, and the cullers and melters of the heavie ſilver coyn of the Nation, fearing if I was not clapt up in the Tower, or ſome other place, they ſhould bee queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for their tranſporting Gold and Silver: Theſe men cryed mee up in the Citty, and to the Parlament for a malignant, and incenſed ſom worthie members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament againſt mee, that did not know theſe mens true reaſons, nor the bottom of their malice; ſo I was ſent to the Tower: <hi>But in the mean time, what miſchief the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth hath gotten by not paſsing the Act againſt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40135:105"/> 
                  <hi>of Gold,</hi> which I was ordered by the Parlament, to proſecute, as appears by the Journals in Parlament, as I before ſaid 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March 1640. The not pasſing this Act hath given an opportunity that all the Gold is ſent out of the Nation, And now many propound the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is to raiſe Gold (Not conſidering the great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and loſs that attends raiſing Gold or Silver) <hi>The like miſchief will ſuddenly fall by ſuffering Goldſmiths to bee the publick Caſhiers, they by that means, cull and melt down the heavy monies of the Nation, And when all is culled and melted down and tranſported, (as I have often times ſaid) then there will bee a propoſition for the raiſing of Silver, to the unſpeakable damage of all Landed Gentlemen, and the Nation in generall will bee impoveriſhed ſo much as you raiſ Gold or Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This miſchief hath com by ſuffering Goldſmiths to becom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers of Gold and Silver and fortaign Coyns, whereas that doth only Properly by the Law of the Nation belong to your Highneſs, And till an exchange bee ſet up by your Highneſs, (and the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths upon great penalties reſtrained only to their working of Plate and gold Rings and Iewels and ſelling them,) It is a thing impoſsible to prevent the tranſporting of Gold and Silver, as I have formerly ſhewed; which the Counſell for Trade will finde upon examination to bee true To which I humbly refer my ſelf.</hi>

               <p>I Had at this day kept theſe Trades Refiners, Gold-wyer-drawers, Silkmen, Weavers and Button-makers (for ſo much as concerns the Silver) in that good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by my Office of Surveyer and Sealer, that no courſe Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould bee made or ſpent in theſe manufactures. And I humbly ſay, I doubt not but I ſhall receive thanks from this Parlament and the Counſel of Trade for my care, in diſcovering ſo many of theſe deceipts and frauds in theſe Trades: As I ſhall particularly make appear before the Counſel of Trade upon examination of this Buſineſs, it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40135:105"/> will ſave the Nation and the wearers of Gold and Silver many thouſand pounds a year. My true end of doing this is, that the Trade may bee regulated, and my place of Surveyer and Sealer reſtored, and I authorized (as I was formerly) under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> to ſearch, ſurvey and ſeal all theſe manufactures, and to ſee them juſtly made, and to have ſuch a juſt Fee as may ſupport my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and in ſome reaſonable proportion pay for my paines and hazzard I undergo by warranting the manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Gold and Silver thread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to bee all good to the Nation, and made according to the Standard. The wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will have this benefit, they ſhall bee ſecured of good Commodities, that doth laſt as long again as the greater part of the manufacture doth now; and when it returnes to the melting-pot, it will make them, in ſome ſorts of lace, as much again as it doth now; and it will ſave many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year which is bruſhed and rubbed away, if the ſilver thread bee duely made with a due proportion of Silk, according to the juſt Rules as I ſetled formerly in my Office.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral unlawfull Engines, called <hi>Wheels,</hi> that twiſt the Silver on the Silk ſo ſleightly, that all thoſe that wear Silver ſpun by theſe <hi>Wheels</hi> are meerly deceived. The women Spinners (being ſome thouſands) have from time to time complained of them, both at the Counſel Table and at the former Counſel of Trade, and the Kings Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners by ſeveral Orders put down the <hi>Wheels.</hi> I moſt humbly deſire, the women Spinners, may bee heard at the Counſel of Trade, concerning that and other abuſes in this manufacture. They will acquaint them, that whereas good Gold and Silver thread ſhould hold ſix ounces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and three ounces of Silk ought to bee the due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the making Needle gold and ſilver, and five ounces of ſilver to three ounces of Silk, of the ſleighteſt: now the manufacture is ordinarily made, for ſome ſorts of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40135:106"/> thread ſix ounces ſilk to three ounces ſilver, and ſo the wearers are cozened half in half; beſides, the ſilver lace is ſo ſleightly made (for many ſorts thereof, being both courſ and adulterate, and ſo thinly covered that it loſeth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) is bruiſed and rubbed off from the Silk, and little returns to the melting-pot: Theſe particulars will clearly bee proved (before the Counſel of Trade upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination) by hundreds of witneſſes when it comes to bee examined; And it is a great Abuſe put on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>There have been within this few years ſeveral other Refiners and Goldſmiths indicted at the Seſsions Houſ in the <hi>Old Bayly</hi> for counterfeiting gold and ſilver; (the Coins of the Nation) who have ſo craftily managed their buſineſs, that ſome of them have eſcaped hanging by miracle.</p>
               <p>If I have my Office eſtabliſhed again, I wiſh them to forbare coming thither to the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> any more for I know by what tricks they have deceived the Jurie and the Court. Theſe men and their fellows are angrie with mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would by no means have mee to have the looking after the regulating of the Trade of gold and ſilver Wyer and Thread. And indeed they have reaſon; for (had I my Office again for Sealing and Surveying this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture) I ſhould ſpoil many a mans cozening Trade, which hee daily now practiſeth, in deceiving the Commonwealth by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull making theſe Manufactures of ſilver Wyer and ſilver Thread <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For I found out where Silkmen had ſold to ſome of the Nobilitie and ſome Honorable perſons ſilver lace mixed with Copper for good Silver. I cauſed the offenders to bee proſecuted in the Starr Chamber for it; and cauſed them to make it good to the parties wronged. In brief, for Five years I cauſed all the Gold and Silver that was ſpent in this manufacture to bee duely and juſtlie made: <hi>(The value yearly out of Silkmens ſhops in</hi> London, <hi>when it was made into Lace and Ribbins, Spangles, Oes</hi> &amp;c <hi>amounted to above Two Hundred thouſand pounds a year Starling, as I have calculated it by my Accompts; for it all paſſed my Seal and Survey, either by mee or my Deputies, ſuch as I was to anſwer to the Commonwealth for the true performance of their Places, and gave Securitie in the Exchequer for their juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.)</hi> I cauſed all theſe manufactures to bee made ſo juſtly and exactly as the Plate and money of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And though ſome that I cauſed to bee puniſhed for their cheating were and are angrie with mee, and got others to back them with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40135:108"/> complaints; by their petitioning to the Parlament in 1641. That I had cauſed ſome of them to bee impriſoned, diſturbed them in their Trades, and ſpoyled and defaced their Wyer, Thread, and Spangles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and made ſearches and ſeiſures in their ſhops and houſes. Trulie I confeſs this part of their petition was true, when I found their Silver was adulterated.</p>
               <p>This I did whileſt I had my Office. And afterwards, for want of doing it, the Nation was Cozened, and at this day is Cozened (as I can ſhew in one hundred and odd ſeveral parcels of courſ and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Silver and gold Lace, Spangles, Purl, Oes and Wyer) All under the hand of Mr <hi>Alexander Jackſon</hi> ſworn Aſſay-maſter of Goldſmiths Hall.</p>
               <p>For the cheating Fellows of the City (let them bee either Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erdrawers, Silkmen, or Refiners) I dare ſware (whether they bee rich or poor) I gave them little reaſon to love mee or wiſh mee well; for I hindred them as much as I could: And I never knew a Thief love a Judg heartily. But there are honeſt men of theſe Trades, both Refiners and Gold-Wyerdrawers, and Workmen, which deſire, I may have my place reſtored to mee; and that wiſh, the abuſes of their Trades and Manufactures may bee redreſſed: For all honeſt workmen are undone for want of a regulation, and power to bee ſettled on ſome ſelect perſons to puniſh, the offenders; And reduce their number, only to ſuch as have ſerved Apprentices to the trades, and to make the workers to conform themſelves to ſuch orders as your Highneſs and Parlament ſhall ſee beſt for the preventing the waſte of the Coyn, and Plate of the Nation. I have humbly preſented a Model for a Regulation of the abuſes to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Trade to which I humly refer.</p>

Whereupon my Maſter commanded mee to put in everie Ingot ſo much Copper as the ſilver waſted, which was about a farthing the ounce: <hi>For Mr</hi> Eman <hi>ſelling the heavy ſhillings halfcrowns and ſixpenſes to other Refiners and Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths in Kinde without melting, would not bear the waſte of melting Mr</hi> Gibbs<hi>'s Engliſh money into Ingotts.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Mr Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> had a pair of Aſſay Ballances in his cloſet, and when hee queſtioned mee about this Buſineſs, hee weighed above ſorrie ſeverall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes of my Maſter <hi>Eman</hi>'s ſilver with the Standard Piece, and all of them fell out one penny weight ſhort; and then hee took about forty other Aſſayes of one Mr <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s Silver (as hee told mee,) and Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> ſaid to mee, This is heavy <hi>Engliſh</hi> mony in Ingots, which I have and do daily buy of Mr <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> and weigh your Maſters Aſſayes againſt his. So I did, and found my Maſters Silver all one penny weight ſhort of Mr <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s Silver. Thereuppon Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> was very hot and angry with mee, and told mee, hee was cozenned, for my Maſter had put Copper into his Silver, and made him pay for good heavy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh money to bee melted-without Copper; hee preſſing mee very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; I told him, I had done it for ſeveral years by my Maſters order, and hee muſt ſeek his remedie from my Maſter <hi>Eman;</hi> for I would ſhew him my Maſters Books every week where I had put the Copper down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Accompt, for my Maſters Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and that I did believ, my Maſter had delivered him to the value of One Hundred and Forty Pounds in Copper, in his Ingots, for which hee had paid my Maſter <hi>Eman</hi> for good ſilver.</note> 
                  <hi>their heavie</hi> Engliſh <hi>monies. Mr Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>one day asked mee ſeriouſly about it; I told him, my Maſter had given mee order to put in ſo much Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as would bear the waſte of the ſilver; and that I did believ, I had put in and mixed as much Copper into his Ingots, by my Maſters order and for his Profit, at ſeverall times, within Four years, for which Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>had paid for to my Maſter after the price of good Silver, as came to above One Hundred and Fortie Pounds Starling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> a few dayes after queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned my Maſter <hi>Emans</hi> about it, who did not denie it; and Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> threatned to Arreſt him, and was in a great rage about it, that hee ſhould bee ſo over-reached and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:</hi> But my Maſter <hi>Mr Emans</hi> ſlighted the buſineſs, and in plain termes bid him do it if hee durſt; ſo that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman <hi>Gibbs</hi> there (for all his craft) was Cozened of one hundred and fortie Pounds, Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> paying for good Silver when hee received Copper mixed in every Ingot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The true reaſon wherefore Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>forbare to Arreſt Mr</hi> Eman <hi>was, hee durſt not have done it if hee had cozened him of ten times as much; for if Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>and Mr</hi> Eman <hi>had gone to Law about this matter, the whole buſineſs of both their unlawfull actions in this Cauſ would have been made known to the</hi>

                  </hi> Gibbs <hi>ſatisfaction for this wrong well enough, if hee had had a minde to have done it, for Mr</hi> Emans <hi>had then a better Estate then Alderman</hi> Gibbs, <hi>and both of them (by this act) had forfeited their Eſtates to the King, it being againſt the Laws of this Nation to melt the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>currant Coines. This was done in the year</hi> 1629. <hi>And had I ſpake but one word of this buſineſs to Sr</hi> Henry Milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may or <hi>Mr Attorney General, or unto the late King</hi> Charles, <hi>(as I had oftentimes oportunity to have done it, being then imploied by the late King in ſeveral buſineſſes by his particular Command; which, had I done it before the ſaid Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>had had his Pardon, Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>had been for ever ſpoiled for being an Alderman; hee might have had a Jack-line about his neck, ſooner then a Gold Chain, Alderman</hi> Gibbs <hi>and</hi> Mr Eman <hi>having by this act forfeited all their Eſtates to the late King.</hi>

               <p>Theſe abuſes are commonly practiſed both amongſt the Refiners and Goldſmiths at this day, without any ſcruple of Conſcience, or honeſtie, or fear of the Law; and (if not prevented) will undoe and waſte the ſtock of the Nation. If Culling and melting down of the hevie cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant monie bee not prevented, the Nation in Generall will not have monie to pay Rents, go to market, or pay Taxes: and this buſineſs to bee neglected, without a ſtrict Act of Parlament to diſcover the Offenders, will bring intolerable miſchiefs.</p>
               <p>

                        <hi>The humble Propoſals of many hundred Spinners to the Counſell of Trade, for the Regulating of the Manufacture of Gold &amp; Silver Thread within this Nation, formerly preſented to the Counſel of Trade at</hi> White-hall 1650. <hi>which ſet forth many of the Abuſes in the preſent making Gold and Silver Thread, and they humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Regulation.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat all work in Gold and Silver Thread may bee wrought by the hand-Spinner, and the Wheeles totally ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if your Honors ſhall permit the Wheels to work <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> Gold and Silver Thread, that your Honors would tie them to their Numbers, and that they preſent unto your Honors the place of their abode, and that ſuch Penalties be put on them, as to your Honors ſhall ſeem agreeable to Juſtice, if they work any other then <hi>ſuperfine</hi> Thread.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That no Silver bee ſpun (either by the hand or wheels) but ſhall contain at leaſt five ounces Silver on a pound <hi>Venice;</hi> and all Needle-gold and ſilver to hold ſix ounces gold and ſilver to nine ounces Thread, and ſo all fine ſilver: and by this Rule the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſhall not bee cheated.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the names of all men and women admitted to make gold and ſilver Thread or Wyer bee kept in a Regiſter, where they live, and all people that are admitted, to put in ſecurity to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40135:114"/> the State, not to work any of theſe Manufactures contrary to the Regulation agreed by your Honors.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That a ſworn Surveyer, that is no Trader in the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, may have the ſurveying and examining of all the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and that hee bee required to look carefully thereunto; and that all ſuch Regulations deſired in our Petition may bee taken into your Honors conſiderations, and the weight of Silver agreed on, what ſhall bee laid on the ſleighteſt Thread on the pound <hi>Venice;</hi> which wee humbly deſire (as aforeſaid) five ounces <hi>Troy</hi> to one pound <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſix ounces <hi>Troy</hi> to nine ounces <hi>Troy</hi> Needle-work; or a greater proportion of Silver to Silk, if it ſhall upon examination by your Honors bee found to bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The truth is, the hand-Spinners cannot make the ſilver Thread ſo ſleight as the Wheels, and lay on ſo little Silver as they do; and that makes the Workmaſters ſtand ſo much for the Wheeles; They ſerving their poor hand-Spinners, as wee have been informed formerly ſom Silkmen did the Silk-dyers, <hi>give them raw Silk, and if they did not make one pound weight ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ounces more then it ought to weigh, being juſtly dyed, the Silkmen would abate it out of their wages for dying:</hi> So the poor Spinners, if they will not ſpin their Silver ſleight to ſome of their Workmaſters, and make Silk go farther then it ought to do if the ſilver Thread bee ſerviceable, they ſhall have no more work; and ſome of them have their wages abated them, and their Workmaſters tell them, They cannot make ſtuff yield ſo much as the Wheels.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whereas your Honors ask us, Which is the beſt cheap to the Common-wealth, either the Wheel-work or the hand-Spinners work: to that wee humbly anſwer; That is beſt cheap to any man that wears it, that laſts moſt and longeſt upon a garment, and not that which is bruſhed and the winde blows away; and that is beſt cheap that yields moſt to the melting-pot, when it comes to bee bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that is our Hand-work; for the Wheel-work, the Silver is almoſt all blown away.</p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40135:115"/>
                     <p n="7"> 7. The wheel-Spinners cannot make any Needle work, which is the chiefeſt and richeſt work; and all Imbroiderie is made by the hand-Spinners work, and Fringe-makers muſt work with hand-Spinners work, if they will work good: and what work is made by the wheels, generally is ſleight cheating ſtuff.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The late King put down the wheels, and cauſed them to bee broken in pieces, that wee poor Women might have a livelyhood (beeing in and about this City many thouſands, that live on the Manufacture of gold and ſilver Thread): the greateſt of the number of theſe wheels have been ſet up ſince there was no regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the Trade, and that every one might work what hee liſt, ſince the Office <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Violet</hi> had (for ſeeing this Manufacture made good) was put down: By which means the Manufacture is grown out of Eſteem; and without your Honors take ſome ſtrict courſe, the Deceipts will daily encreaſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And if there bee not a ſworn Officer to do Juſtice, ſome of the Wyer-drawers will force ſome poor hand-Spinners to make ſleight ſilver Thread, which their neceſsity will compell them to do, to keep them from famiſhing; and the work ſo made is fitter to burn then for any other uſe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Whereas the wheel men ſay, They were bound Apprentices to the Trade of Spinning gold and ſilver Thread, wee deny that any was bound to the Trade</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If the Wyerdrawers would deal truly with your Honors, they could tell you, it is their great gain they make by the cheating wheel-work, more then by our labor which work good work, that makes them ſo ſtickle for their wheels. Wee do humbly deſire, that ſome of the prime Taylors and Silkmen and Goldſmiths may bee warned to attend your Honours: the Goldſmith will ſatisfie you what a ſleight return the Silver wheel-work makes to the melting pot, being almoſt all waſted, and blown away with the winde: The
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40135:115"/> Taylor will tell you, they are almoſt aſhamed to ſow it on; And the honeſt Silkman could wiſh all ſleight wheel-work were put down, but that they muſt bee forced to ſell ſuch as their Neighbours do, or elſe loſe their Cuſtom. The Silver Thread is worſe made now and ſleighter then ever it was; many ſorts of Silver Thread ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not half the proportion of Silver it ought to have, and as it had, when <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> had the Regulation.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>THere was ſeveral perſons deſired the Counſel of Trade, that <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> (who was formerly imploied in the Regulation of this Manufacture, and knoweth the way of diſcovering all the Frauds in this manufacture) may have the Place of ſurveying and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all courſe and adulterate Silver in thread and wyer, and to ſeal all good Gold and Silver-thread. The ſaid <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> from time to time to ſearch with the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Aſsiſtants of the Companie of Goldwyerdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or by himſelf and his Officers, for all courſe Silver that is wrought in this Manufacture to the deceipt of the Nation. And that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> may have ſuch allowance for the executing of the ſaid Office, as may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to defray the neceſſary charges for the ſtrict ſearch and due regulation of this manufacture; for it cannot bee well done without a great deal of charges.</p>
                  <p>If your Honors truſt the management of this Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture only to the Wyerdrawers, without naming and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a ſworn Surveyer &amp; Sealer of this Manufacture, one who is no Trader in theſe Commodities, (the Buſineſs to bee carried on ſingly by the Wyer-drawers) will never do your work to have a juſt Reformation: For everie Maſter-wyer-drawer will winck one at another, and they will by that means (under colour of Reformation) cozen
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40135:116"/> the Nation by a Law, as was done in the dying of Silk: when the Silkmen had the Regulation, all ſuch perſons the Company envied, were found out and puniſhed; in the mean time, the Governers, Maſters and Aſsiſtants they cheated and cozened the Nation more then ever it was before, and no man durſt ſay, <hi>Black was their Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like Abuſes and greater will bee practiſed, if the management of the manufacture of Gold and Silver wyer bee wholly left to the Refiners and Wyerdrawers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a third perſon which is no Trader, either Refiner or Wyerdrawer, and therefore not intereſſed by benefit to bee corrupted by making the manufacture ſleight or deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: And this wee can ſay, If there bee any Refiner or Wyerdrawer angrie with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Violet,</hi> it is becauſe he would not ſuffer them to cozen the Common-wealth, but cut and defaced all ſleight Gold and Silver thread. And hee tied all the workmen to make good and juſt Gold and Silver thread, ſuch as was juſtly covered with a due proportion of Silver, to a due proportion of Silk, that would laſt twice as long to the wearer as the ſleight wheel-work.</p>
                  <p>For whereas <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> by himſelf and his Officers cauſed the Gold-wyer-drawers to work all their Silver thread (from 1635 to 1640.) ſix ounces Silver at the leaſt to three ounces of Silk to all Needle work, and five oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Silver to three ounces of Silk for the ſleighteſt ſilver Thread; and any ſilver Thread that was under this ſize and proportion of Silver and Silk, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> was authorized to burn it or deface it, which many times when hee found it hee did deface it. And this made ſome of the Wyer-drawers angrie with him, whereas it was their own faults to work ſleight ſilver and to come within his danger; <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> did but his duty to deface their courſe and ſleight ſilver Thread.</p>
                  <p>But this wee can affirm, during the time <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> had the Office, hee cauſed all the Silver Thread to bee made of good Silver; and there was never (for the generalitie)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40135:116"/> ſo good Silver Thread made for the uſe of the Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mr Violet</hi>'s Regulation, or ſince, as was during all the time hee had the Regulation by his Office. If <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> were impowered to make his Searches at this day, (as hee did formerly) hee would (no doubt) finde manie Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds of courſ Silver Thread in <hi>London,</hi> and Silver Thread which is as bad as courſ Silver.</p>
                  <p>wee pray your Honors to mark what wee ſay. whereas (by a juſt Regulation) ſix ounces of ſilver and three ounces of true died ſilk is the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue proportion for the juſt making of ſilver thread: There is now (ſince all this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture is run into diſorder, and made without a Rule) Gold and Silver ſpun upon heavie died ſilk, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Gold and Silver thread made, three ounces Silver to ſix ounces Silk, and Four Ounces Silver to Five Ounces Silk.</p>
                  <p>And this Silver ſo unjuſtly wrought and ſpun, to the deceipt of the Wearers, is made and mixed in their Silver Laces, and other manufactures, and ſold to the Wearers by the ounce for good Silver thread, whereby the Wearers are cozened half in half; and of this ſort of Silver thread there is ſold in Silkmens ſhops many thouſand pounds a year; and this Silver thread made upon the Wheels ſo ſlight and thin the Silver is ſpun, that it will not abide on the ſilk du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the weaving and making the Lace, and the Tailors will declare to you, while they are ſoing the Lace on the Garment the Silver will ſhed and fall off the Silk, and when it comes to the weather, a Fogg or Rain, the wet gets into the Silk, and then the Silk ſwells and breaks the ſilver (the Plate being ſo thinly made that it flies off; and when it is dirtie, rub the Lace and you wiil leav nothing but ſilk: This, all that wear it, can tell you. And in this manner is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny 1000 pounds a year Bruiſed, Cracked, and rubbed away: whereas, if the Silver was all juſtlie and trulie made with a due plait, and a due proportion of ſilver and Silk, the Lace would laſte as long again, the Silver Lace would make as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40135:117"/> much again as it now doth; and Twenty thouſand pounds a year in Silver would return to the melting Pot which by this ſlight making is bruſhed off, and waſted, and comes to bee blown in the dirt. the Goldſmiths can tell you gold and ſilver Lace juſtly made, will make you three ſhillings the ounce, and three ſhillings and ſixpence the ounce to burn; your ſlight Wheel-work will not make above one ſhilling or eighteen pence an ounce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Wyerdrawers and Refiners have good reaſon to crie</hi> Tho. Violet <hi>down to the Parlament and Counſel of State; for they know hee will hold their noſes to the grind ſtone (as hee did formerly) and make them to make good work, if hee bee reſtored to his Office which hee formerly had. The Refiner hee will have an eie on, that hee melt not, nor cauſ to be melted any of the currant Coins or Plate of the Nation, but onely Forrain Bullion imported for this Manufacture; and this was ſtrictly looked to whileſt</hi> Tho. Violet <hi>had his Office; and the Refiners by their Indenture with the King Covenanted to do ſo, and not to melt the currant Coin or Plate of the Nation for any of theſe Manufactures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Wyerdrawers will do any thing rather then to bee tied up to have their Silver Thread ſealed. They know, then they muſt work it all good ſilver, and a due proportion of ſilver to a due proportion of true died ſilk It is not the Fee that they are to pay is that that ſticks with them, for that is a trifle in compariſon; it is, they ſhall bee conſtraind to make all good Silver Thread with a due proportion of ſilver: this is the Yoke they would fain fling off themſelves.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Proceedings of all the miſcariages of the Governors and Aſſiſtants of the Refiners and Wyerdrawers was at large Painted out in</hi> Parlament, <hi>as tending onely to get a Licence for ſome particular men to Cozen the Commonwealth, and all others to bee puniſhed.</hi>

               <p>There are divers of the workmen Wyerdrawers that have been with mee ſince the Workmaſters preſented the Draught of their deſired Corporation, and told mee, that the Maſter-wyerdrawers have (in the Draught of their Corporation which they delivered unto the Counſel of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40135:118"/> Trade in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, 1656. omitted divers particular Rules which conduced very much to the well ordering of the Trade and manufactures; and have inſerted particular Rules onely conducing to their own private ends (being Maſter-wyerdrawers) and not for the generall good either of the workmen of the Trade, or of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The workmen deſire that the workmaſters of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture may bee reſtrained, and for the future may not (as they do) force the workmen (for their private gain) to make their work ſleightly and adulterate: <hi>That there may bee a ſworn Surveyer and Aſſayer appointed; one that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Workmaſter nor workman, but an indifferent conſcionable man between them both;</hi> that may Survey and Aſſay all work made, and to bee made; and may ſet Rules and Orders between the workmaſters &amp; workmen, that ſo the work-maſters may not cauſ the workmen to make baſe, ſleight and adulterate work, for the workmaſters private gain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And that the Workmen may not bee ſo beaten down in their Prices, that they cannot make a livelihood; that the Surveyor may appoint the Aſſaymaſter, who may trie and make Aſſayes of all work made into Silver and Gold thread, wyer, Purles, Spangles,</hi> &amp;c. that ſo the manufacture may bee made of fine ſilver, not under Starling, but as much better as every Trader pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> (who was formerlie imployed in the Regulation of this Manufacture, and knoweth the way of diſcovering all theſe Frauds and Deceits in the making and working of this manufacture) may bee Surveyor and Searcher to ſeiz on all courſ and adulterate ſilver, in wyer and thread <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for all ſleight work: And that your Honors ſet Rules and Orders for the puniſhing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and that all gold and ſilver Wyer <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may bee well and juſtlie made: And that <hi>Tho. Violet</hi> may have ſuch a Fee allowed him for his ſervice and pains taken therein, as may ſupport his Charges, and recompence him for his ſervice, care, and pains to bee taken therein, and for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting to the Nation that all the ſilver ſhall be juſtly made,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40135:119"/> and that ſtrict penalties, ſhould bee put and laid uppon all work-maſters, that give their work men cours adulterate Silver to work, to draw Gold or Silver wyer, and that all workmaſters bee forbidden to cauſ the workmen, to draw their ſilver to ſuch extraordinary ſizes for ſlightneſs, that when it is twiſted on the Silk it is ſo thin, it cannot bee made ſerviſable to the wearers, but with the wind or Rain, drops of the wearers Garments; <hi>I wiſhed theſe men to put to their hands to theis laſt aforeſaid propoſals, which for the preſent they refuſed, telling mee, I knew theſe things to bee true, aſwell as themſelves; The reaſon why for the preſent they would not ſet to their hands was, They would ſee firſt, whether there was an Intention, of the Parlament, or Counſell for Trade, really to reform theſe abuſes, and to ſee good Silver lace, ſpangles &amp;c. ſhould bee wrought and made in the Nation, and to puniſh strictly the offendors; when they were once aſſured of that, they would diſcover the whole bottom of the workmaſters knavery and oppreſsion, and how many of them deceiv the Common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wealth; But if they ſhould bee ſeen to diſcover theſe abuſes, before they were aſſured the Parlament would reform them, by their diſcovery, they ſhould bee undon; for ſom of their workmaſters would bee ſtarke mad with them; And that ſom of them have been threatned by their work maſters (the maſter-wyer-drawers) never to bee ſet on work by any of the maſter-wyer-drawers, if ever they petition againſt, or diſcover any the frauds of their workmaſters, in theſe Manufactures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like tyranous threatning, many of the Maſter wyer drawers, have uſed to the women ſpinners to terrifie them from ſpeaking the trueth: So that many of theſe workemen to the maſter wyer-drawers, and alſo the women ſpyners of gold and ſilver thread, are in a ſad condition every way; They muſt worke courſ deceipfull gold and ſilver thread and wyer, and muſt not, nor dare diſcover it, uppon pain of being undon, by ſom of their cruell Work maſters Som of them with tears in their eys have told mee, they were forced to worke their Work Maſters, courſ and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40135:119"/> ſilver wyer and thread, (contrary to their conſent) to get bread; And that their Maſters have ſo peſtred the trade formerly, with taking a multitude of apprentices, for private and preſent gain, that now, not one half of the Journiemen, can get work to put bread in their heads: That the Journymen, ſtand in more aw (many of them) and fear, to diſpleaſ their Workmaſters, then their appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices doe; And this is the true reaſon, ſo much bad ſleight ſilver thread is made.</p>
                  <p>If one man will not work at, ſuch ſizes, and ſuch price (that the Silver ſhall run ſuch a length, that many of the Workmen even dravv their eyes out of their heads;) So that vvhen the Silver com's to bee put on the Silke, it is in a manner, as thin as a gilt on a bay leaf, the vvind vvil blovv the Silver avvay of the ſilk: and then the vvheele-men and hand ſpinners, muſt agree vvith ſom of theſe vvorkmaſters, as the Silkmen did vvith the Dyers, they muſt make one pound of ravv Silk, vveigh, tvvo pound, vvhen it com's from dying; ſo the Maſter vvyer-dravvers vvill, and at this day do, force many of their Worke-men to make Silver, three ounces Silver to cover ſix ounces of ſilk and fovr ounces ſilver to cover five ounces of Silke, and this is ſold for good ſilver thread by the Maſter vvyer dravvers and Silkemen, ſo that the vvearers are Cozened many times half in half, And this makes Knaves againſt a regulation, For they can get more by ſelling ten pounds vvorth of this ſleight and deceitfull Silver Lace, then they can do by ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fourty pounds vvorth of good ſilver Lace: this is the true reaſon, vvherefore they vvould have no Sealer, but vvould have the Regulation of this buſineſs left amongſt the Refiners and Wyer-dravvers themſelvs.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is the Subſtance of the Women ſpynners, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Journymen vvyer-dravvers deſires, at this day, vvhich they vvould give under their hands, and proſecute it, by hundreds, if they vvere aſſured your Highneſs and the Parlament vvould appoint a ſtrict Regulation of theſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40135:120"/> abuſes in their Trade; They will attend the Counſell of Trade and humbly preſent their deſires concerning all the premiſes.</p>

                  <hi>My moſt humble Petition to your Highneſs and the Parlament is, For the ſpeedy paſsing the Act againſt Tranſporters of</hi> Gold <hi>and</hi> Silver, <hi>&amp; againſt the Cullers, and melters down of the heavy Coyns of this Nation, and ſuch as buy</hi> Gold <hi>or</hi> Silver <hi>above the price of the Mynt.</hi>

                  <hi>to the houſ. The Committee of the Navy,</hi> 2. September 1647. <hi>direct their order to the Commiſsioners and officers of the Cuſtoms and particularly to</hi> Mr Edward Watkins, <hi>then head Searcher, and they were all deſired to conſider of ſom courſ to prevent the Tranſportation of Bullion out of the nation. In</hi> October 1647. <hi>All the Commiſsioners with the chief officers of the Cuſtom-houſe ſet down ſeveral waies for the prevention of the Tranſporting of Gold and Silver, which the Marchants by all ſecret means do daily Tranſport. The Committee of the Navy by their order of the third of</hi> Dec. 1647. <hi>directed their order to the officers of the Mint, to certifie their opinions, what waies &amp; courſes were to bee taken for preventing the Tranſporting of Gold &amp; Silver out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The officers of the Mint, after great conſultation and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, having taken good advice; (ſom of them having had long experience viz.</hi> Mr. Palmer <hi>and</hi> Mr Cogan <hi>were the fitter to give advice) firſt the officers of the Mint upon their certificate deſire that all the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver, and ſuch as have melted down the currant Coyn of the nation, may bee brought to juſtice to Deterr others from acting the like abuſes for the future. Secondly, that according to the preſident of the ſtatute of</hi> 14 Richard 2. Cap. 12. <hi>A Commiſsion bee granted to make enquirie through the nation after all ſuch as had conveyed the moneys of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland out of the nation, and of all ſuch as culd out and melted the heavy currant money,</hi> 4 Hen. 4. Cap. 10. <hi>the</hi> ſixth <hi>of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 6. Cap. 19. <hi>Touching the exchange of Gold and ſilver to bee put in execution, that whoſoever gives more for Gold or Silver then it is or ſhall bee declared, ſhall make fine at pleaſure of the State, To conclude they ſay in their Certificate, that the Mint cannot bee imployed, nor the Tranſporting treaſure ſtopped, if ſom courſ were not ſpeedily taken to diſcover theſe great abuſes, and already all the Gold is Tranſported out of the nation, and the Silver followeth apace, and this is the Certificate of all the chief officers of the Mint.</hi> 3. December. 1647.</p>
               <p>About <hi>November</hi> 1647. The Citizens of London petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Parlament againſt the Tranſporters, of Gold and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40135:122"/> Silver, ſhewing the great miſchiefs that came to the City thereby.</p>
               <p>The 18 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1649. The Counſell of State orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that a Committee ſhould bee appointed, to take into their conſiderations, the buſineſs of the Coyn, and the Par between this and other Nations: and that there bee care taken, that the Coyn of this Nation may bee kept from carrying away out of the Nation; And to conſider of ſom means how the Mint may bee ſet on work. In purſuance of this laſt Order, the then Counſell of State did give order for the draught of an Act, which was drawn by order of the Committee for the Mint, And I <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> was required by the Counſell of State to attend this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, And upon ſeverall meetings and debates, of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Honorable members of the then Counſell of State; The draught of an act of Parlament againſt tranſporters of Gold and Silver was finiſhed, and left by order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament in Mr. <hi>Auguſtin Garlands</hi> cuſtody; and the ſaid Act was twice read in the Houſ, &amp; about the 12 of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1653. following called for again, and apointed to bee finiſhed; as apears by the Journals of the Houſ: But other mighty buſineſs did intervene.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it pleaſ Your Highneſs!</hi> It was eaſily to bee diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ſom guilty Marchants, who had been guilty of Tranſporting of Gold had hindered this Act from paſſing; and I know all the Members in that Parlament were not free from tranſporting gold and ſilver, and that made ſome of them ſay, as long as they ſat within the Parlament wall, that Act, againſt tranſporting gold, culling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coyns or buying of gold and ſilver, contrary to the law, ſhould never paſs the houſ.</p>
               <p>Former Ages have made tranſporting gold and ſilver Fellony, as appears by ſeverall Statutes; And all ſuch as

               <p>I have for theſe many years, preſſed for an act of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee made according to the Statute of 14. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. cap 12. for Comiſſions, to go through the Nation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of ſuch as have conveyed the gold and ſilver, out of England, to the prejudice and damage of the Nation. 9. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 3. 17. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. cap. 1. 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. cap. 4. 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. cap. 10. 9. <hi>H.</hi> 5. cap. 1. 2. <hi>H.</hi> 6. cap. 6. 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. cap. 13. 1. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 13.

               <p>
                  <hi>THere was about twenty milions of gold and ſilver, coyned in the Tower, from the year</hi> 1622. <hi>to</hi> 1645 <hi>as will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ppear by the Mynt books, upon a calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which</hi> The Clerkes <hi>can quickly finde out to a penny) and all this gold is already tranſported, the currant ſilver coyns all culled and the heavieſt tranſported or melted to make gold and ſilver lace, and that monies which remains is clipped and light. And theſe miſchiefs have been acted by perticuler perſons and will every day increaſ, without ſome ſpeedy and timely remedy bee had, to find out the Offendors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The currant Silver coyns of the Nation have been greatly ſpent, in making the manufacture of gold and ſilver wyer,</hi>

                  <hi>thread &amp;c. formerly in the years, from 1624, to 1630. There beeing then a war with Spain, Starling ſilver was ſold, by the Goldſmiths for five ſhilling and three pence and five ſhilling and four pence, the ounce, Now the money in the Tower is coyned at five and a pence, So that all but the clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and verie light mony was melted down, to make plate and gold and Silver wyer and thread. And this was known to bee the generall practice, of almoſt all the Goldſmiths and Refiners in London. I moſt humbly ſay. There is never an honeſt Goldſmith in London, that will have the face to deny this to bee a trueth, Silver was then ſo ſcarce that in payment of a thouſand pounds you ſhould receiv nine hundred pounds in gold, and then in 1629. men were troubled to get ſilver monie for gold, Silver was ſo ſcarce: The Eaſt India company bought up in thoſe years, Spaniſh monie and dollers and gave four ſhilling 10 pence a peice for them, which is five pence in a peice of Eight more then they will make in the Mint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now your Highnes hath a warr with Spain the fountain of Silver is diverted for the preſent, ſo that ſilver riſeth, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Goldſmith weighs and culls all the Silver, that paſſeth through his hands, And as the market riſeth ſo doth the Goldſmith lighten his plummet, or weight hee culls the Mony of the Nation with, till at laſt they will cull and melt it all up.</p>
               <p>Som Goldſmiths in Lumbert ſtreet, (contrary to the law) have bought and ſold Milions of Gold till now at laſt, they have bought &amp; ſould all the Gold out of the Nation, and the currant Silver coyn of this Nation, is following after a great pace, and will ſtil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low except a ſtrict Law bee made to diſcover the offendors, and bring them to ſevere juſtice to deterr others, there will be no mony left in the Nation. neither gold nor ſilver. The ſad effects of ſuch a miſcheif is not ſuddenly apprehended, for no great action can be don without monie; And the long Parlament though they could not then agree, for the paſsing of an act againſt the Tranſporters of Gold and Silver, yet they excepted all ſuch as tranſported Gold or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40135:124"/> Silver, or culled or melted the currant coyns, or bought or ſold gold and ſilver, contrary to the Laws and ſtatutes of the Nation from the generall Pardon. A Commiſsion to enquire and find out the offendors, directed to ſkillfull diſcreet perſons, and authorized by act of Parlament, according to former preſidents will bring in good ſtore of monies towards the payments of publique debts.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſ your Highneſs (for the Regulating of Gold and Silver thread) If the Refiners and wyer drawers bee not tyed to refine all the ſilver for their manufactures, in one place, and not to melt any ſilver but what ſhall bee Imported from beyond the Seas, or ſhall proceed from burnt ſilver, Returns of their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, and this to bee duely and ſtrictly enjoyned them, and that culling and melting of the currant Silver monie of the Nation, for theſe manufactures Bee, for the future, made Fellonie; and ſtrickt Rules and ordinances to provent all the frauds formerly practiſed both by the Refiners and wyer-drawers, (which offences are by me moſt humbly preſented to your highneſs, &amp; the Parlament for a redreſs and reformation) If there bee not ſuch officers and Miniſters appointed as aforeſaid, This manufacture will never bee regulated nor the frauds prevented. I do alſo implore your Highneſs Grace and Juſtice for the Reſtoring mee to my place which I had, and to have ſuch ſees as formerly I Received, and I to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Manufacture to bee juſtly made to the nation, or pay the damage to any that are damnified by any gold or ſilver thread, ſealed in my Office. And that your Highneſs and the Parlament, will bee graciouſly pleaſed out of your Benignity favorabily to accept of theſe your loyall ſubjects Endeavours to do your Highneſs and the common wealth moſt humble and faithfull ſervice; which ſhall for ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige mee dayly to proceed, and for ever to Remain your humbleſt Loyall Subject.</p>
